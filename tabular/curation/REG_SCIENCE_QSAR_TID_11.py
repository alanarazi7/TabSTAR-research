This dataset contains QSAR data (from ChEMBL version 17) showing activity values (unit is pseudo-pCI50) of several compounds on drug target TID: 11, and it has 5742 rows and 1026 features (including IDs and class feature: MOLECULE_CHEMBL_ID and MEDIAN_PXC50). The features represent FCFP 1024bit Molecular Fingerprints which were generated from SMILES strings. They were obtained using the Pipeline Pilot program, Dassault Syst√®mes BIOVIA. Generating Fingerprints does not usually require missing value imputation as all bits are generated.
