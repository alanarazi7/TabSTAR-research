text (object, 269 distinct): ['David Perdue: (00:01)\nHow great is it to be back in Macon, Georgia with Donald Trump coming to Macon again? I want to thank Governor Kemp because he laid it out just now, but let me remind you of something that happened in 2002. Sunny just mentioned it. Because of you, we turned this thing around, and for the last 18 years, we have built a state that’s now the number one state in the country in which to do business.\nDavid Perdue: (00:25)\nThat did not happen by accident. Brian Kemp is the third governor in a row that understands how to do that. And thanks to you, that’s going to continue. Today, we have an opportunity. Every generation has an opportunity like this. They have their moment of crisis. With Donald Trump, it’s all about promises made and promises delivered. After eight years of Joe Biden, you hear Joe lately? Joe said the other day, he said, “Oh yeah, you guys were enjoying that economic Renaissance because of what we did with Barack Obama.”\nDavid Perdue: (01:06)\nNow guys, I’m just a dumb business guy for right over that hill, right there, and I can tell you, that is a lie right out of the pit of hell. Donald Trump, after eight years of Barack Obama and Joe Biden giving us the lowest economic output in U.S. history, and we felt that right here in Georgia, Donald Trump gave us the best economic turnaround in U.S. history, y’all.\nDavid Perdue: (01:36)\nSeven and a half million new jobs, highest middle class income ever measured, the lowest unemployment for African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanics ever measured. After 800,000 people, under Barack Obama, fell into poverty, under Donald Trump, six and a half million people have lifted themselves out of poverty, y’all. Now that’s America.\nDavid Perdue: (01:57)\nBut it took Donald Trump, not the bureaucrats in Washington, not some career politician, but it took Donald Trump to build that wall. It took Donald Trump to move that embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It took Donald Trump to name 200 new federal judges, including Neil Gorsich and Brett Kavanaugh. And next week, we will know that we will confirm Amy Cony Barrett. Mark my words.\nDavid Perdue: (02:43)\nIt’s one thing to stand up here and cheer. It’s one thing to stand up and remind everybody. This guy is providential. He didn’t happen by accident. How in the world, in our political system, could Donald J. Trump come on the scene in 2016 and do what he did? Tell me. But God’s watching. He’s watching what we’re going to do right now. What’s at stake is this, and I mean this: It’s our time to stand up to the socialist movement that for the last 100 years has been trying to take over our beloved America.\nDavid Perdue: (03:27)\nIt didn’t just start in the ’30s. It started long ago, but they believe they have it in their grasp now. They believe these CNN polls and CNBC polls. Oh, let me tell you, they don’t know the big red poll right here. But this is what I believe is a stake. Mark my words. They believe this. That if they get the majority of the Senate and they win the White House, Joe Biden has already said, your taxes are going up, guys.\nDavid Perdue: (03:56)\nHe’s already said. You know those regulations that those mean old demonic Republicans, all those regulations you pulled back, we’re going to give it back to you. You know that healthcare that we screwed up? We’re going to do it again. But most importantly, guys, they want to stack the Supreme Court. Did you see that? They want to stack the Supreme Court. Now what President Trump has done is brought balance back to the Supreme Court. These aren’t activists. These are constitutionalists. They’re up there to protect you and me.\nDavid Perdue: (04:32)\nBut the most insidious thing that Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden are trying to perpetrate, and Bernie and Elizabeth and Kamala, or what? Kamala or Kamala or Kamala mala mala, I don’t know. Whatever. They’re trying to perpetrate a lie, and that is that socialism, this radical socialism that they’re trying to sell us, is better than our beloved democracy. We’re not going to let that stand.\nDavid Perdue: (04:57)\nAnd here’s how they’re going to do it. You stack the courts, you change the voting rules in the Senate, and pretty soon you start adding democratic states. You get rid of the electoral college or change it like they can do, and pretty soon you’re talking about a one-party state, guys. That failed in Russia in 1917, it failed in Cuba in 1959, Venezuela today. You can’t find a country in the world where that has ever worked.\nDavid Perdue: (05:19)\nNow why in the world would we ever go down that road, particularly after the last 75 years in this country where God has blessed us so greatly that we can come out today and say what we want independent of what that media says? I need you to do one thing. Stand with me, stand with our President, and let’s make damn sure that the road to socialism never runs through the state of Georgia. God bless you guys.', 'Joe Biden: (00:06)\nWhat do the patients most miss when they talk to you about what they miss most about … Is it seeing their families? Is it seeing their grandkids? I mean, what do they talk to you most about?\nShanrika Nelson: (00:21)\nThey talk to me mostly about not being able to spend that quality time with their family, not being able to see them like they normally do before the pandemic started. Their family members used to visit a lot, so they are more concerned about not being able to interact with other residents, other staff, and seeing their families on the regular.\nJoe Biden: (00:40)\nYeah. Well, you know, it’s a smart thing to do for … what you guys are doing. It’s about something much bigger, though. It’s about making sure we provide dignity and respect for work you do.\nShanrika Nelson: (00:55)\nYeah.\nJoe Biden: (00:55)\nI think the president has a duty to care about that, and that’s what I want to try to do with you all. I’m interrupting you here, keep going.\nShanrika Nelson: (01:06)\nHow significant are caregivers to you?\nJoe Biden: (01:09)\nWell, they are the future. Look, I look at it two ways: I had a friend who used to say, “It’s great when conscious and convenience cross paths.” My conscience knows because, look, I’ve been a significant recipient of caregiving, my mom and dad, separately, years apart, died in my home with hospice. I lost a wife and a daughter in an automobile accident, my two boys, I watched nurses and nurses’ aides nurse them back to health.\nJoe Biden: (01:47)\nI spent 18 months with my son Beau dying of stage-4 glioblastoma cancer, and I was hospitalized for a while, long time ago, with an aneurysm. I tell you what, doctors let you live, but nurses and nurses’ aides make you want to live. You give hope, you give hope, you’re incredibly, incredibly important to the psyche of families.\nJoe Biden: (02:18)\nI just can’t tell you … but secondly, you also, we’re in a situation with this pandemic where, if we do what we have to do and focus on dealing with making sure that we deal with caregivers in a way that we haven’t up to now, we can ensure in a financial burden is taken off of working families who are struggling to pay the cost of caring for their loved ones.\nJoe Biden: (02:45)\nIn addition to that, we’re in a situation where you also deserve to be paid. Now, expanding the options for older Americans is a gigantic, gigantic opportunity, and for both in-care facilities, easing the financial burden, low- and middle-income families will, under my plan, spend no more than 7% of their income on childcare for kids under five, but also deal the same with expanding for the elder care. You got to expand options for older Americans. My plan expands options for older Americans to receive care at home as well.\nJoe Biden: (03:26)\nAn example is, there’s a pilot program going on right now in 27 cities in 16 states where a nurse, an occupational therapist and a handyman go to visit a home of an aging family member, and they may not be able to cure Mom’s Alzheimer’s, but they can make sure she doesn’t fall and break her hip, they can walk through the house and install handrails in the right spots in the bathroom, fix the door so it doesn’t stick and she tries to open it, creating millions of jobs to help people in this economy recover.\nJoe Biden: (03:58)\nIt saves a lot of money, it costs about 3,000 bucks to do that, but what it does is in fact saves hundreds of thousands of dollars so people aren’t hospitalized and the like. But what you do in a facility like the one you’re in is critical. You just give people hope, it really matters so much. You deserve to be paid better than you’re being paid now.\nShanrika Nelson: (04:22)\nOkay, I like that.\nJoe Biden: (04:24)\nNo, I really mean it. [crosstalk 00:04:25]\nShanrika Nelson: (04:25)\nWhat I hear where I’m at now is staff complaining about the proper PPE that we are to use when we come to work every day. So I hear what they … the protective wear.\nJoe Biden: (04:35)\nYep.\nShanrika Nelson: (04:36)\nThis is the isolation gown that you are to pin on your body before you do any type of care on any resident in the facility. [inaudible 00:04:47] that we are to wear, something like the one that I have on, to protect your face from anything. [crosstalk 00:04:54]\nJoe Biden: (04:54)\nDo you have enough of the … [inaudible 00:04:59] do you have enough of the PPE in these months of late? I mean, do you have all you need?\nShanrika Nelson: (05:06)\nYes, we do. [crosstalk 00:05:07]\nJoe Biden: (05:07)\nThat’s great.\nShanrika Nelson: (05:07)\nI’m glad about that, because my facility, we have enough PPE, they made sure of that from the beginning. We had a glitch in the system in the beginning, but now we are fully prepared. We have everything that we possibly need.\nJoe Biden: (05:24)\nWhat’s it like getting used to wearing the PPE?\nShanrika Nelson: (05:28)\nI don’t think we ever got used to it.\nJoe Biden: (05:29)\nYeah.\nShanrika Nelson: (05:32)\nIt’s hot. The weather changed outside, it’s very hot to be wearing it, but we know it’s important. We have to wear it to protect ourselves.\nJoe Biden: (05:39)\nHow do the patients respond to y’all?\nShanrika Nelson: (05:44)\nThey got used to it. In the beginning, they used to be like, “Are we sick? Why are we wearing this?”\nJoe Biden: (05:49)\nYeah.\nShanrika Nelson: (05:49)\nThen once they started being more educated on the importance of us having it, because they wear it as well. It’s important for them to wear it as well.\nJoe Biden: (05:59)\nAll right. Where are you now, in a patient’s room?\nShanrika Nelson: (06:02)\nYes. Right here, I’m the resident’s room. And in this room, if it was two residents that occupied each bed, the amount of time that we would have to spend with these residents is around 15 minutes. Imagine only spending 15 minutes with a resident, especially when they need you the most. When you’re short-staffed, you can’t spend the quality time with your residents’ needs.\nJoe Biden: (06:32)\nWhat would it take to recruit more people to do what you’re doing?\nShanrika Nelson: (06:36)\nBetter pay wages.\nJoe Biden: (06:38)\nPardon me?\nShanrika Nelson: (06:39)\nIf we had better pay wages-\nJoe Biden: (06:42)\nYeah.\nShanrika Nelson: (06:43)\n-then we would be able to recruit more people.\nJoe Biden: (06:45)\nWell, that’s what I’m intending on making sure you’re able to do. Also, so you can also, at the same time, be in a position where you can, if you decide to, get additional training to go from being what you’re doing now as a nurse’s aide to become a practical nurse, to become a nurse. I mean, there’s ways we can do this that will greatly increase your opportunities, increase pay, increase the services that people have, and generate economic growth in the nation overall, helping everybody, because the more you get paid, the more taxes you pay; the more you spend, the more the economy grows.\nShanrika Nelson: (07:24)\nRight, right. And that’s what we need them to understand.\nJoe Biden: (07:28)\nI understand it, we’re going to make sure everybody else understands it too. I think people are realizing it, they’re realizing one of the reasons why they’ve been able to stay safe and stay home is because people like you are out there risking your lives every day, taking care of folks who need help, and no one else can take care of, and no one else is taking care of.\nJoe Biden: (07:50)\nHow many patients do you have on your daily routine? How many patients are you responsible for?\nShanrika Nelson: (07:57)\nI’m responsible for anywhere between 13 to 15 residents a day.\nJoe Biden: (08:03)\nWow.\nShanrika Nelson: (08:05)\nAnd that’s a lot, and especially because we’re short-staffed and the pay is not good.\nJoe Biden: (08:11)\nThat is a lot. Well, my son-in-law is a surgeon in Philadelphia at Jefferson Hospital, and he tells me, it’s not the same thing, but he tells me about the incredible stress on staff and nurses’ aides and nurses that exist throughout the whole system, but you have to do it every day. Those people get to know you, don’t they, your patients? They’re looking forward to seeing you, because … what kind of questions are they asking?\nShanrika Nelson: (08:42)\nThey ask how long is this going to be going on, when are we going to be able to see our families?\nJoe Biden: (08:49)\nYep.\nShanrika Nelson: (08:49)\nWhen are people going to open up the economy, because they want to be able to visit their family. They want to be able to see their family. They’re lonely.\nJoe Biden: (08:58)\nYep. Now, do you have any mental health workers at the facility that are able to, when you need that extra help with a patient?\nShanrika Nelson: (09:10)\nI didn’t hear what you said, what’d you say?\nJoe Biden: (09:12)\nI said, one of the things we’re finding out nationally is there’s a lot of strain on mental health, there’s a lot of concern and anxiety, and there’s a need for psychologists and others to be able to get engaged and helping people deal with what’s happening in terms of their concerns about their anxieties. Do you have folks at your facility that are able to do that, when you have a patient that’s particularly anxious about something?\nShanrika Nelson: (09:46)\nWell, we used to before this pandemic, and a lot of people are not able to come into the facility, so we are the ones who are to sit there and talk to them.\nJoe Biden: (09:58)\nGotcha. So there’s no staff personnel that deal with mental health problems.\nShanrika Nelson: (10:05)\nNo.\nJoe Biden: (10:05)\nAnd anxiety. Okay. That’s a big issue.\nShanrika Nelson: (10:11)\nYeah, it really is, it’s a really big issue. That’s the reason why, one of the reasons why I joined a union. 10 years ago, I became a union delegate because the union allows us the opportunities to have a voice for our co-workers and for our residents.\nJoe Biden: (10:32)\nYep.\nShanrika Nelson: (10:36)\nThat’s why we need you. That’s why we need you to become president, so you can stand with us and help us with the Fight For 15 wages, affordable healthcare for all, union security, and for people to be allowed to join a union if they want to.\nJoe Biden: (10:54)\nWell, I guarantee you that’s my view. I’m union guy all the way through, and I think it’s the only way we can make sure that you get compensation and the patients have the best-trained people, and that you’re able to advance and learn more and more and increase your ability to give … do the job you do, and increase your pay as well.\nShanrika Nelson: (11:19)\nYeah. My long-term healthcare goal will be for us to have better staffing, better wages, job security, and you as our president.\nJoe Biden: (11:35)\nWell, I can get you the first three if I get to be president, but thank you very, very much for saying that. And thank you for what you do, thank you for what you do. Like I said, it’s slightly different, but I watched the nurses’ aides helping my mom in hospice and my dad in hospice, and was in my home for months. I watched how they care, I watched how critical it was, and I watched what it did to their psyche, how it just helped them. It gave them some hope.\nJoe Biden: (12:21)\nWe going in [inaudible 00:12:22] room?\nMatt Yarnell: (12:28)\nHi, Vice-President, how are you?\nJoe Biden: (12:30)\nI’m well.\nMatt Yarnell: (12:31)\nGood. This is Matt Yarnell, I’m president of our union, I’m super-excited to be able to jump here in for a minute while Shanrika is getting her service back up. Really appreciate you taking the time to meet with Shanrika and learn a bit more about her role as a caregiver in a nursing home. I was a former caregiver myself before I became president of our union here in Pennsylvania.\nMatt Yarnell: (12:53)\nJust real quick while we’re waiting for Shanrika, she lifted up, I think, the need for more staffing in nursing homes and the need to be able to really have a seat at the table when it comes to thinking about what the nursing-home industry and the long-term living industry looks like. We’re really excited to hear more from you about your thoughts on the plan that you unveiled yesterday around caregivers specifically and how we can really support the incredible work that Shanrika and her colleagues all around the country do as nursing home workers and long-term care workers.\nMatt Yarnell: (13:26)\nLast thing I’ll say before I let you answer that question is, COVID has wreaked havoc in a devastating way on nursing homes, we know that nationally, 57,000 deaths have been in nursing homes of nursing home residents, that’s more than 42% of the country’s deaths related to the pandemic. And in Pennsylvania specifically, we have 756 facilities where there’s been 21,000 cases, and actually about two-thirds, or 67% of the deaths in Pennsylvania have been in nursing homes. We’re really excited about the plan that you unveiled yesterday around caregiving, which is so important and wanted to hear a little more from you about how you are hoping to make advancements for folks like Shanrika who get up every day and care for those who can’t care for themselves in this country.\nJoe Biden: (14:18)\nWell, first of all, the caregivers in nursing homes should have a say in what they need. A lot of those places, including in your state, you pretend it isn’t true, but it is true, have not had the PPE they need to begin with. There’s an enormous burden on families financially, and there’s an enormous burden on the workers. Easing the financial burden on working families who are struggling to pay for the cost of caring for their loved ones.\nJoe Biden: (14:51)\nNow, no low- and middle-income family under my plan will spend more than 7% of their income, and they’re going to average, families … going to save them thousands of dollars a year. Expanding care options for older Americans, my plan expands option that, in fact … Americans receive care at home as well. For example, as I said to Shanrika, there’s a pilot program-\nShanrika Nelson: (15:19)\nI’m here.\nJoe Biden: (15:21)\nI beg your pardon? I didn’t hear. Anyway, you got 800,000 folks under Medicaid, trying to figure out how they can get home care help without having to go to a nursing home, so there’s a program in 26 states where you take an occupational therapist, a nurse as well as a handyman, they come to the home of those 800,000 people, because we’re going to give the states more money to find alternatives to deal with this. And while they might not be able to cure Mom’s Alzheimer’s, but they can make sure that she doesn’t break her hip when she walks to her door, as I told Shanrika, they find handles in bathrooms and they fix doors so they don’t stick.\nJoe Biden: (16:09)\nThey’re creating of new jobs to help the economic recovery, and elevating the pay and dignity of work as well. These workers haven’t gotten respect they need, but what it does overall, this is a win-win-win. It will increase the opportunity for caregivers to up their skills by providing for them to be able to go on and move from one level to another with the training they’ll be able to get for free, it’ll make sure we’re in a situation where the family is able-\nJoe Biden: (19:12)\n– low- and middle-income families going to be in a position where they can’t afford basic necessities to take care of their elderly parent or someone with a chronic disease. I’m sorry, I’m confused who I’m talking to here. But anyway, whoever it is …\nShanrika Nelson: (19:37)\nHello, Vice-President Biden. I just want to say I appreciate you doing this walk a day in my shoes, and thank you for everything.\nMatt Yarnell: (19:47)\n[crosstalk 00:19:47] Mr. Vice-President, I want to just say I appreciate Shanrika’s leadership here and know the technological challenges of living in the COVID world here, but she’s been an incredible leader of our union and we really look forward to working with you and your administration on the other side of this election to make sure that … the rules have been really not fair, frankly, to caregivers and nursing-home workers and to home-care workers across our country.\nMatt Yarnell: (20:11)\nWe really look forward to working with you and your administration to make sure that folks like Shanrika, caregivers, have a seat at the table to figure out how do we come up with the solutions to make sure that people get the best care in the setting they choose and to make sure that workers have a right to be at that table, and make sure that they have a good life for the non-stop caregiving they do across this country.\nJoe Biden: (20:32)\nAnd they can also have a right to up their skillset.\nMatt Yarnell: (20:36)\nSure.\nJoe Biden: (20:36)\nThey should also have a right to move beyond, if they want to, beyond where they are in terms of their skillset, to move beyond where they are and … look, Shanrika, how [inaudible 00:20:47] healthcare during this crisis?\nShanrika Nelson: (20:49)\nHow do I … I couldn’t hear what you said.\nJoe Biden: (20:51)\nI said, how has the union helped you and your colleagues during this COVID crisis?\nShanrika Nelson: (20:59)\nWell, they allowed us the opportunity, they always checked up on us to make sure that our facility had the right and proper PPE, and that every day we was well taken care of. Every day, I was always on the phone with my organizer, and she was like, “Do y’all have everything y’all need for today?”\nJoe Biden: (21:18)\nGotcha.\nShanrika Nelson: (21:18)\n“Are they providing everything?” So they have really been working firsthand, they have been going out to facilities, making sure that all the other facilities have proper PPEs as well. So they really had our backs during this whole pandemic.\nJoe Biden: (21:31)\nNow, I know you may not know the answer specifically, it may be an unfair question, but how short are you in terms of personnel in the nursing home you are dealing with? How many more people you need doing your job with you?\nShanrika Nelson: (21:47)\nWe need … depending on each unit, because every unit is run differently depending on the amount of residents that you have in the unit. Typically on the unit that I work, which is a short- stay unit, it holds 55 beds. So we need-\nShanrika Nelson: (22:03)\n… a short stay unit, it holds 55 beds. So we need at least the ratio for residents to CNA should at least be accounted for. It needs to be looked into. So we shouldn’t have no more than eight or nine residents to one CNA, especially if you have 55 residents. No facility should have to work with 15 to 20 residents a day.\nJoe Biden: (22:28)\nI agree. And look, let me ask you one more question. I’m sorry to hold you up, but it’s a big help to me. What has it meant to your family? Because I’ve done a lot of interaction with the folks doing what you do in hospitals, in community centers before this as well. A lot of people are worried that when they go home, they may be bringing home to their family the virus, and maybe bringing home to their family some problem. When you leave work to go home, are there certain things you do that are different than you did before?\nShanrika Nelson: (23:24)\nWell, I was saying that I was so scared in the beginning when this pandemic first came about and we was trying to protect ourselves. So I wasn’t able to see my family for like months, because I didn’t want to expose them to anything that I might come in contact with while I’m working. So it’s been a bit strained.\nJoe Biden: (23:44)\nGotcha. Have any of your coworkers gotten the COVID?\nShanrika Nelson: (23:49)\nNo.\nJoe Biden: (23:49)\nGood.\nShanrika Nelson: (23:50)\nNot as I know of. I haven’t had any.\nJoe Biden: (23:52)\nGood. Well, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you taking me on your tour. Mr. President, you’re looking for me, too?\nMatt Yarnell: (23:59)\nI just want to swing back in. Really appreciate Shanrika for her time here today, really leading us in the first of its kind virtual Walk a Day. And thank you, Mr. Vice President, and look forward to working with you and your administration in the future here.\nMatt Yarnell: (24:13)\nI know we’re going to move now, I think, to the worker roundtable, and so just wanted to appreciate both of you, and I look forward to this conversation being continued as we move into the future. It’s one that’s desperately needed. So thanks so much.\nJoe Biden: (24:25)\nShanrika, thank you. As my mother would say, were she’s still alive, you’re doing God’s work good.\nMatt Yarnell: (24:29)\nAmen.\nJoe Biden: (24:29)\nYou really are. No, you really are.\nShanrika Nelson: (24:33)\nYes. I appreciate you. Thank you so much.\nJoe Biden: (24:35)\nI promise-\nShanrika Nelson: (24:35)\nI appreciate you doing this Walk a Day in My Shoes, and closing I just want to say my job is awesome. I love working at [Somerton 00:24:43] Center, and Somerton Center and myself thank you for doing this Walk a Day today. I really appreciate it.\nJoe Biden: (24:50)\nI hope I can come and actually walk it with you, physically walk it with you.\nShanrika Nelson: (24:54)\nI wish you could. I really do.\nJoe Biden: (24:55)\nAll right. Thank you.\nShanrika Nelson: (24:58)\nThank you.\nMatt Yarnell: (24:58)\nTake care, stay safe.\nSpeaker 1: (24:59)\nBefore the pandemic, we were already in crisis. I’ve always been an essential worker.\nSpeaker 2: (25:04)\nI’ve always been an essential worker.\nSpeaker 3: (25:06)\nI have always been an essential worker.\nSpeaker 4: (25:08)\nThis is about us, the people who are working to keep this country safe, keep this country clean, keep this country safe and healthy.\nSpeaker 5: (25:16)\nWe are fighting for the right to a decent life for all working families.\nTerry Thomas: (25:22)\nThe stakes are higher than ever. We can’t afford another four years of this. We need a change.\nJoe Biden: (25:35)\nEvery single frontline worker should have the personal protective equipment that they need to be safe.\nNimo Ali: (25:41)\nLack of planning and willful neglect has left most of the healthcare workers at risk of contracting the virus.\nJoe Biden: (25:48)\nIf Donald Trump prevails in court, insurers would be allowed once again to strip away coverage, jack up premiums, simply because of the battle they survived fighting coronavirus.\nRhonda Miller: (26:01)\nNo matter what my gender is, what my job is, what my race is. Everyone deserves a good quality of life.\nJoe Biden: (26:10)\nEveryone in this room should have a minimum starting at $15 an hour wage across the board.\nSpeaker 6: (26:17)\nWe need a union to fight for better wages. We need a union to fight for better benefits.\nJoe Biden: (26:24)\nOnly one way you can fight back power is with more power, and that’s union power. We should unionize McDonald.\nDebra Dawson: (26:35)\nUnions have to be on the forefront of bringing people together and changing our country.\nBobby Roy: (26:39)\nUnions are social justice organizations.\nPamela Owens: (26:42)\nRacial justice is a situation that we’ve been dealing with all our lives.\nJoe Biden: (26:47)\nWe can’t leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism.\nPerla Canales: (26:56)\nI’m coming this country in 1993 when my husband passed away. I have four children. I has to make a hard decision for better life for my kids. My life is in the finger for this administration.\nJoe Biden: (27:13)\nOn day one, I’m going to stand the legislative immigration reform bill to Congress, provide a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nBobby Roy: (27:23)\nWorking people and our families need to be engaged in the civic engagement process.\nVivian Deniston: (27:27)\nSomething is going to happen. There’s going to be a change. A really good change. It’s going to be Joe Biden.\nSpeaker 7: (27:38)\nHe is for equality, fair housing, affordable healthcare. He is for the people.\nChris Ellis: (27:46)\nTo me, it’s a clear choice to vote for Biden.\nVivian Deniston: (27:48)\nHe’s going to be the president.\nTsoganesh Endogoshet: (27:50)\nIt’s supposed to Joe Biden.\nTerry Thomas: (27:51)\nI’m going to use that same energy to get Joe Biden in for President. You’ve got to win.\nMary Kay Henry: (29:41)\nHello. Welcome to the essential worker round table with Vice President Joe Biden. I’m Mary Kay Henry president of SEIU and I’m so proud to welcome you, Mr. Vice president, for the amazing work that you’ve done in making crystal clear to everyone in this nation that you see care workers and you feel their immense difference they make each and every day and yesterday you told the nation that you’re going to make care jobs the cornerstone of the next American economy. That includes all of us.\nMary Kay Henry: (30:16)\nAnd we’re so, so proud of your commitment to that and your absolute clarity about the way in which working people have power across the service sector in this country is through their union. So thank you for joining us. Thank you for that amazing Walk a Day that you just did with Shanrika. You are making history in so many ways, Mr. Vice-president. That’s a first ever for SEIU to do a virtual Walk a Day through a nursing home. Thank you and welcome. And we’ve been joined by these other essential workers that I’m proud to introduce you to, but let me just pause for a second to welcome you, Mr. Vice President.\nJoe Biden: (30:59)\nMary Kay, it’s great to see you and all the frontline workers. You risk your lives every time you go to work and the question is how to protect y’all and to make sure you get respect that you deserve. But Mary Kay, I just can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. I’ve been the recipient of the incredible work, my family and my extended family, that all the people on this call do. And it really makes a difference. You change people’s lives. And a lot of people wouldn’t be able to live the lives they’re living now without you. They’d be in real, real trouble.\nJoe Biden: (31:44)\nAnyway, why don’t I, as my mother would say, hush up, and [crosstalk 00:31:48] whatever you want me to do next. But Mary Kay, thanks for being my friend, thanks for the support. And by the way, this is a case where not only have an opportunity to make sure we provide better care and affordable care to more and more people, particularly in that sandwich generation, those who are taking care of a mom and taking care of a child at the same time, as well as making sure that we provide more jobs, better paying jobs and more respect for the people providing that kind of care.\nJoe Biden: (32:21)\nAnd the consequence of all that, even the people who aren’t crazy about my ideas acknowledge that this will in fact increase economic growth and everything gets better. The economy will grow. We can employ by this program over the next four years about 5 million people, better pay people and put people back to work who in fact can’t work now because they can’t afford the care and people who can afford it, who are providing the care, they’ll be able to afford to live because they’ll get a decent wage. And now we’re going to employ more people.\nJoe Biden: (32:53)\nSo there’s a lot going on here. As you heard me say before Mary Kay, and I’ll stop, my mother used to say, ” Everything terrible, Joey, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.” This is an opportunity. An opportunity for us to deal with systemic racism, systemic inequity, as well as providing a better life for an awful lot of people.\nMary Kay Henry: (33:14)\nGreat. Thank you so much, Mr. Vice-president. We’re going to do a rapid fire round from the caregivers in the healthcare sector, home care and hospitals. Then we’re going to deal with two leaders that are confronting corporate power in fast- food and airlines. And then we want to tackle with you the anti-immigrant, anti-Black racism that’s raging in this country and what our union is doing to unite with you to end it once and for all. And then we want to wrap it up with investing in public service work at a state and local level.\nJoe Biden: (33:50)\nAll right.\nMary Kay Henry: (33:51)\nSo I’m going to introduce Suk Kim is part Of our incredible home care leadership team. Suk, welcome.\nJoe Biden: (34:00)\nI can’t hear you, Suk. You got to press-\nMary Kay Henry: (34:06)\nSuk, we can’t hear you.\nSpeaker 8: (34:08)\nPress the-\nJoe Biden: (34:08)\nThe button, yes.\nJoe Biden: (34:19)\nWe can’t hear you, sorry.\nMary Kay Henry: (34:22)\nSo I’m going to move to Marlin and then come back to you, Suk. We’ll figure out the audio. Marlyn.\nMarlyn Hoilette: (34:31)\nHi, my name is Marlyn Hoilette. I am a member of 1199 SEIU Healthcare, union workers in Florida. I’m a proud immigrant from the Island of Jamaica. I’ve been a registered nurse for 24 years.\nJoe Biden: (34:49)\nGod loves you.\nMarlyn Hoilette: (34:51)\nAs healthcare workers, we are the ones on the frontline every day taking care of patients. Safety is our number one issue. I believe the safety of patients, workers and families is far more important than healthcare organization’s profits. We don’t have hazard pay and we are pressured to return to work before having enough time to take care of our loved ones if they get sick. All healthcare workers should get personal and family medical leave. We’re given non-branded mask-\nJoe Biden: (35:29)\nI lost her.\nMarlyn Hoilette: (35:37)\n… top of that, my coworkers and I contracted COVID-19 earlier this month. It was very devastating for all. Some coworkers were even hospitalized with severe symptoms of COVID-19, which was very sad. For me, I quarantined at home in my room. I took my medications on my own. My son and my husband moved downstairs and would bring food to my door. It was a very frightening experience for them, but they took the best care of me.\nMarlyn Hoilette: (36:22)\nI am a fighter, and that’s why I’m here to share my experience today and to tell the stories of my coworkers. Without saying, it goes that we need proper PPE. Here in Florida, COVID-19 is on the rise and I am worried that my coworkers and myself might not survive a second time. Our lives are literally on the line in this election. My union members and myself, including Suk, risk over lives every day we go to work. Mr. Biden, as president, how could you protect us [inaudible 00:37:06]?\nJoe Biden: (37:07)\nFirst of all, let me say to you that if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. I spent a total of seven months and three months in ICU. I watched them take care of my son who was dying of a glioblastoma for 14 months. I watched them when my wife and daughter were killed, bring my boys back because they were in the same automobile when the tractor-trailer hit them. And as I said earlier, doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live. You have that special thing. You give hope, the mere fact that you’re there. You guys don’t even, I think, sometimes realize it. You lie there and you look at that screen in the ICU and you know if the line goes flat, you’re gone. But you don’t care after a while. You don’t really care, even if you’re not in pain, you just get tired of it. And I had nurses at Walter Reed hospital who would bend down and whisper in my year.\nMarlyn Hoilette: (38:13)\nWow.\nJoe Biden: (38:13)\nAnd go home and get me pillows. They would make sure… Actually, probably nothing ever taught in-\nJoe Biden: (46:47)\n(Silence) …sure you and your coworkers and others get paid and people are able to go back to work. That family you’re helping out. If you didn’t show up, they wouldn’t be able to go to work. And so you’re going to put them back to work, but we’re going to also put a lot more care workers to work. We’re going to bring more people in with you to make sure that you are able to continue to provide the services that in many cases are life and death for people. It’s gigantic what you’re doing. And so don’t ever run yourself down based on you’re from South Korea or anywhere else. Let me tell you something, the reason were so strong as an ancient because we are a nation of immigrants. That’s why we are strong. No, I really mean it. I’m not just trying to be nice. It’s the God’s truth, because what people don’t understand, as I said once to a world leader, the reason why we do so well is we’re the most unique nation in the world.\nJoe Biden: (47:44)\nAs a nation of immigrants, we’ve been able to pick the best from every single culture, it took courage 40 years ago for your family to pick up and move. It took courage for my great grandfather to get on a coffin ship in the Irish sea to come to the United States of America. It took courage, optimism, determination. That’s why we’re who we are. So don’t let anybody convince you, you are not American in every single way. It’s an idea. We’re an idea. It’s not based on an ethnicity or race. I’m sorry to get so worked up about it, but it makes me so angry when I find that people based on the color of their skin or their national origin are somehow viewed in a different way.\nJoe Biden: (48:34)\nAnd look what he’s doing now. He’s blaming everything on China. He’s blaming everything on the Chinese. He blaming everything, and people don’t make a distinction as you well know, from a South Korean and someone from Beijing, they make no distinction. It’s Asian.And he’s just using it as a wedge. If he had moved, when he should have moved. When we knew about this, Columbia School of… In New York pointed out, there’d be 57,000 more people alive today if we moved just two weeks earlier, he’s trying to shift the blame. You deserve [crosstalk 00:49:12]\nMary Kay Henry: (49:11)\nAnd we love it when you get angry Mr. Vice President, and Suk is as angry as you are. We really appreciate your passion. Thank you so much [crosstalk 00:49:21]\nJoe Biden: (49:20)\nReally. You know, I mean this. This is [crosstalk 00:49:22]\nMary Kay Henry: (49:23)\nI know you do. I know you do. [crosstalk 00:49:25] …for your amazing leadership from SEIU 2015, and now I’m going to turn to Adriana Alvarez a movement leader in the global fight for 15, and a union. Adriana is from Illinois, Mr. Vice president. And she wants to tell you her story. Adriana?\nAdriana Alvarez: (49:44)\nThank you, Mary Kay. Hello, Vice President.\nJoe Biden: (49:47)\nHow are you?\nAdriana Alvarez: (49:48)\nI’m good. Like she said my name is Adriana Alvarez. I’m a crew member at McDonald’s. I’ve been there for almost nine years now. I a single mom of an eight year old boy. His name is Manny. And we’ve been struggling way before the pandemic. We live in a basement that frequently floods. I have to use sub pumps to be able to get all the water out. If there’s too much rain it’s overwhelming. I can barely afford to pay the day to day things that my son needs, or if we have to go to doctor visits I work for McDonald’s.\nAdriana Alvarez: (50:24)\nI don’t get any kind of benefits. I’m making poverty wages. Even with this pandemic pay, it’s hard to make ends meet. And this national COVID crisis has brought on new and difficult challenges for me and my son. There’s no school I have to deal with. Who’s going to babysit him while I work. It’s just too much. And like most fast food companies McDonald’s has deemed us essential workers, but they have yet to treat us as such. My take home pay and work schedules are all over the place. We are instructed to wear masks and gloves, but our store is so small. There’s no way that we can do the six feet social distancing. And it’s just extremely risky. They’re lobbying against providing paid sick leave to its employees. McDonald’s is lobbying against paid sick leave at a time where we need it the most.\nAdriana Alvarez: (51:20)\nAnd not just at my store, but a lot of these stores, it’s working mothers who are at risk for our kids’ safety because we’re in the middle of this. And our duties, we’re essential. Our work shifts are essential and I’m constantly worried about getting me myself sick or coming home and spreading it to my son. And I try not to explain it to him. He’s only eight. I want him to have a childhood. I don’t want him to worry about me. He’s already so worrisome about me. I don’t want to add to that. So no parent who works hard and plays by the rules should have to go through what McDonald’s is putting us through. We help them make billions of dollars in profit and I just don’t think it’s fair that they’re abusing us this way. And I know that Peggy knows exactly what I’m talking about and I’m going to turn it over to her so she can give us a little bit about her story.\nJoe Biden: (52:17)\nHey, Peggy.\nPeggy Vonner: (52:18)\nHi, Mr. Vice president. Thank you. My name is Peggy Vonner and I work at Bush International airport and I’ve been furloughed since March. And I am worried when I go back to work that I might catch the COVID-19 because my workplace isn’t taking it seriously because of my age and like of insurance. I know I’m at high risk and I shouldn’t have to choose between paying bills or survival in my industry that’s been taking care of the billions and bailout money. I don’t see how the industry is taking care of me or other workers. When we don’t have hazard pay or safety guidelines, we need to hold industry like mines accountable to make sure they use bail out money to directly benefit workers with health care, sustaining wages, benefits, corporates like McDonald’s, and United Airlines need to pay their fair share. Vice President, Biden as president, how would you work for us?\nJoe Biden: (53:37)\nWell, first of all, I’ve said from the very start I’m running to rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class, and this time to make sure everyone comes along. Wall street didn’t build this country, the middle class did. And unions built the middle class. Unions are the ones keeping the barbarians at the gate. There used to be a basic bargain in America, working to help make a business successful, got to share in the profits. If an enterprise hit hard times, everyone took a hit up and down the line from the secretary to the CEO. Today that bargain has been broken. Now the only people of benefit when the company does well are the CEOs and the shareholders and the only people that get hurt when the company hits rough times are the workers. There was a study at the University of Massachusetts done from a 10 year study from 2003 to 2012.\nJoe Biden: (54:32)\nIt’s going to get a little wonky here, but I always talk about it because it’s important to focus on. 54% of the frontline of the fortune 500 companies, profits went back to buying, they made over $2 trillion over that period of time. Okay? 54% of that went back to buying back their stock, which increased the value of the stock that was left. And that’s how CEOs get paid mostly. 37% of that went to making sure that they paid dividends to their stockholders. 9% was left for research, training, equipment, salaries, growth, it’s wrong. The people who do the work should share in the gains. This administration doesn’t believe in accountability instead of getting relief to working families and main street businesses, the president’s bumping his corporate pals to the front of the line, with all this aid that’s coming out of the Congress and bailing out big corporations that isn’t going to their employees and it’s not helping main street workers, 40% of all the additional small business money that was going out there, didn’t get to small businesses at all.\nJoe Biden: (55:48)\nThe single biggest recipient of this have been hotel executives and major Trump donors. And the president has weakened safety regulations restricted over time period. And we all work as a lot better deal. Governments should not only defend workers rights to organize, but encourage collective bargaining across the board. And, look, I’ll fight for workers and union paid. Everyone should be entitled to sick leave and a minimum wage of 15 bucks an hour, not as a ceiling, but as a floor. Require employees to provide fair scheduling. You should have a saying in it. Crack down on employers who are trying to block organizing, including holding CEOs accountable for labor law violations. We got to make sure that federal contracting dollars only go to employees who support unions. We’re going to lay out a bold plan to build back better that, and that means union jobs.\nJoe Biden: (56:42)\nLet’s go back and talk about what’s happening to you in firms of, well, let me… If we’re going to revitalize this country, we got to make sure we invest in things that are going to create good union jobs. There are a few things that are going on here. Number one, McDonald’s, let’s take a look at McDonald’s I’m going on too long. And I apologize, but let me talk about McDonald’s for a second. McDonald’s making billions of dollars, but here’s the deal they’ve made you all sign non-compete contracts that you cannot go across town to try to get a job at Burger King. And maybe, and I’m not saying you could, but you get 25 cents an hour more. People who are hourly workers are required to sign non-compete, I will not go anywhere to any business, like the one I’m in, to get a raise.\nJoe Biden: (57:37)\nWhat the hell is that all about? It’s all about suppressing your wages. It’s unfair. They should be eliminated these noncompete agreements. Secondly, we should be able to unionize, McDonald’s not based on [inaudible 00:57:49] across the board. They should be able to utilize each of these franchises. That’s what we should be able to do. And I’m going to make sure that is able to be done under the law, and any company that tries to stop that from happening will pay a penalty and a price. You talk about what’s going on, and if you get back to work at the airline, well, if you’re a sanitation worker going in and making sure that you’re going to make sure that other people don’t get sick, we should take care of you. You should be getting a premium pay. You should be having all the equipment and needs.\nJoe Biden: (58:25)\nYou have to make sure that you do not get the virus. In addition to that, we should make sure that the airlines know that they have to be part of what I’m going to guarantee happens. There’s going to be paid sick leave and family leave for every worker in America. It’s only basic, my dad used to have an expression. And I said, apologize for Mary Kay, she’s heard me, we’ve become friends for so long she heard me say it, but it was really what he’d say, because he lost the job. He never went to college. He knew what it was like, the bust his neck. And he’d said, “Joe, a job’s about a lot more than the paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey is going to be okay and mean it.” That’s the minimum we should be able to do.\nJoe Biden: (59:20)\nSo, the reason I’m confident, I’m going to be able, if I’m president, get paid family leave and sick leave and make sure we have minimum wages that are increased, and a label to organize is two reasons. One, the American public knows you guys are the ones that have kept them safe. It’s not a joke. Not a joke. You’re the ones who have kept them safe. You’re the ones that allowed them [crosstalk 00:59:49] You really have. And the [crosstalk 00:59:50] …taken off, and they went, “Oh, my Lord, I didn’t realize this.” And they really didn’t. Wasn’t they don’t care, they didn’t think about it. When I tell people about noncompete agreements, you can’t go across town and try to get a 25 cent or a dollar raise. They go, “How can they do that?” They’re doing it to millions of workers. It’s Wrong. It’s going to end I promise you. [crosstalk 01:00:17]\nMary Kay Henry: (01:00:16)\nAnd that’s why we’re so committed to building America back better with you, Mr. Vice President. [crosstalk 01:00:25]\nJoe Biden: (01:00:25)\nWell, we really can’t, Mary. [crosstalk 01:00:27] I am optimistic.\nMary Kay Henry: (01:00:29)\nYeah. I agree with you. I agree. We have three more leaders we wanted you to hear from. And then your closing remarks. [crosstalk 01:00:38]\nJoe Biden: (01:00:39)\n…all too long. I apologize.\nMary Kay Henry: (01:00:42)\nThat’s all right. We’re concerned about your time. I welcome at Ambar Arellano and Joe Prather, and then once they finished, we’ll see Helen Esposito come on. Oh, I think Helen’s joining us now. Wonderful.\nJoe Biden: (01:00:55)\nHey, Helen. [crosstalk 01:00:56]\nMary Kay Henry: (01:00:55)\nDo you want to kick us off? Ambar is your sound open?\nAmbar Arellano: (01:01:03)\nOh, hi. Hello. Hello. My name is Ambar Arellano. I’m a janitor from Seattle Washington, and I’m an [inaudible 01:01:14] member of SEIU local six. And well, as a Mexican ,I’m too familiar with the type of racial hate Suk talk about earlier I’m a janitor, and my job can’t be done from home. Even in this pandemic, I have to work every day, risking my health and my family’s to keep buildings clean and safe for others. Many janitors who keep our country safe and running are immigrants. Their bosses abuse their power by using the lack of a status of the workers against them. These bosses pay workers without paper, less than minimum wage.\nAmbar Arellano: (01:01:54)\nThey threaten to have the immigrants janitors deported if they speak up about safety hazards or try to organize a union for better conditions. Well, this isn’t right. Employers should not be allowed to abuse their power and influence. No working person in our country should be voiceless no matter what they look like, where they from, and what they do for a living. This is how they try to divide us against each other, the same way they try to divide immigrants and black workers in APA, and [inaudible 01:02:33] …Latino workers against each other. So, well, I’m going to hand it over to Joey. Who is going to ask you a question about that.\nJoe Biden: (01:02:41)\nOkay. Thank you.\nAmbar Arellano: (01:02:42)\nThank you.\nJoe Prather: (01:02:45)\nHello, Mr. Vice President. My [crosstalk 01:02:47] My name is Joe Prather. I live in Ellenwood, Georgia. Right outside of Atlanta. We was taught 401 years ago that the first boatload of slaves arrived in Jamestown, Virginia. After that blacks experienced slavery, they was tortured. Some escaped. Women was raped. Some was lynched. Families were separated. And then we had the Civil War. Shortly after that slavery was abolished. It still wasn’t good for blacks. They had less assets to home ownerships, to education, social security. And years after that, we had the civil right movement. We marched, we protest. We fought for voter rights. We was attacked by dogs, beat by the police, sprayed now with fire hoses. And some of our great leaders was assassinated. Despite all of that history, black people in this country, including myself have managed not only to survive, but in many cases strive.\nJoe Prather: (01:03:58)\nI work at Marsha Distribution Center. There I’m a equipment operator. It’s a great union job. I’ve been there for 28 years. I also met my beautiful wife there. Also, I was able to send my daughter to college. There’s a lot I could do myself, but it’s one thing I can’t do myself. Mr. Vice president, I can’t overturn systemic racism that black Americans face every day. Mr. Biden, no one in this country will truly be free until this country is free of systemic racism. We know it’s not just a black problem. It’s an American problem. And with that being said, I have two questions to you, Mr. President, if you’re elected the next president of the United States, what would you do to set America free by ending systemic racism? And what would you do to help all of us, no matter who we are. Black, white, Brown, native born, or immigrants like my sister Ambar, here stand to fight systemic racism.\nJoe Biden: (01:05:09)\nShould I say the question now or is another speaker?\nMary Kay Henry: (01:05:12)\nThank you so much, Mr. Vice president. Joe, that was such a powerful question. I just want to get Helen Esposito in, Mr. Vice President, and then [crosstalk 01:05:21]\nJoe Biden: (01:05:21)\nThen I’ll answer all three.\nMary Kay Henry: (01:05:23)\nFabulous. Thank you. Helen?\nHelen Esposito : (01:05:26)\nHi, good afternoon, Vice President. It’s an honor to get to meet and speak with you. I’ve been an employee with the New York State Department of Labor since April of 1993. I started out as an inter clerk, and in 2000 I became an adjudicator or better known labor service representative. I’ve worked through several emergency situations since then. I’ve worked through 9/11, the airline recession crash following, Hurricane Sandy, two major floods in the upstate region, the recession from 2008 to 2014 and now will be instruct by COVID-19. When COVID-19 hit us, it’s 10 times worse than all of the-\nHelen Esposito : (01:06:03)\nWhen COVID-19 hit us, it’s 10 times worse than all of those put together. We could not have expected the enormity of the situation, nor were we prepared at all. The record number of those affected and out of work, not only here in New York, but the seven surrounding states of people who work within the state has resulted in myself and my coworkers working seven days a week for 12 hour days. As a mother and grandmother, I’m extremely worried about the economic impact COVID is having on our nation.\nHelen Esposito : (01:06:32)\nToday, many of my colleagues across the nation of fighting layoffs and we’re all facing cuts nationwide. Prior to my going out of surgery recently, I never saw my family. I would only come home, eat, drink, sleep, get up, start all over again. Seven days a week. Sadly, my colleagues are facing many hardships at this time. We are in need of funding and other resources so that we can be prepared in case something like this reoccurs. Instead of fixing the problem, some states are just laying off people because they’re not getting the support they need from the federal government.\nHelen Esposito : (01:07:07)\nSenator Republicans have not acted on the HEROES Act, which we are still waiting on. So far, I am lucky and not in a state where layoffs are occurring. I have been out of work at one time and I’ve never forgotten what that was. This makes me a better adjudicator when I’m helping the many people who are facing the unknowns of today and tomorrow. Those of whom we have elected placed into office need to do more. They need to make sure that people can maintain a roof over their head, food in their bellies, and a sustainable life for their children. Mr. Biden, Vice President Biden, my question to you is this. How important is it for Congress to continue to provide support for the states, the cities, the communities, so that we don’t have people consistently being laid off, losing their jobs, and also them failing to invest in our communities all over once again?\nJoe Biden: (01:08:03)\nWell, each one of those questions is profound and they each… Or as we used to say, it’s an essay answer. And I could go on for an hour in each one of them, but let me start and work my way backwards here. Okay? I want to say that the work you’re doing in New York is really important. It starts off with making sure that you’re you got lucky. You got lucky and lucky that you have a governor who’s a real person, understands what’s going on. Leadership matters. It matters who’s in charge, number one.\nJoe Biden: (01:08:42)\nNumber two, I’ve been through each of those terrible situations you’ve talked about. I was a Senator. I got elected and I was 29 years old when Dr. King was assassinated and Bobby Kennedy. 1968 I graduated and I got elected in 1972 and [inaudible 01:09:03] to take office. And so, I’ve been through each of those crises you talked about, and my deceased wife is from New York, upstate New York in the Finger Lakes region. And I went to Syracuse. So I’m familiar with your state. Here’s the point I want to make to you. When we had the financial crisis and the collapse of the economy, what the president did is he turned to me and he had me personally handle the so called Recovery Act. That required the distribution of $840 billion, almost a trillion dollars in 18 months to keep the economy from going into a depression. I handled it personally, myself, all of it. And the deal was that we knew, first of all, I knew I spent time with 157 mayors, every governor, but one, the governor from Alaska. And the vast majority of the people who were county executives and elected officials. And what we did, we were able to get out to the states and the counties and localities because each of the states, and you all know this, have to balance their budget.\nJoe Biden: (01:10:13)\nThere’s a reason why the founders are wise enough not to require the federal government to have to balance its budget. Because in times of critical emergencies, they could step in and fill the void. So what we did, we saved as you well know in New York State millions of jobs across the nation. Teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, first responders across the board. State employees did not have to be laid off. And that’s why we were able to go through with virtually no lay off of employees who needed to get the job done for the rest of the country, including everything from janitorial staff in schools, the bus drivers, as well as the teachers and the principals.\nJoe Biden: (01:10:58)\nAnd so we need to pass the HEROES Act, which has money for the states to be able to sustain their ability to fight the crisis, not increase unemployment, and provide for a way forward for people. And you have the majority leader in the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell saying let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt? The states? That is absolutely a stupid thing to say. And I don’t usually say those kinds of things about senators. So we have to pass the HEROES Act and we’ll get that done. I did it myself. I managed every single penny that went through that personally. And we had overseers. We had inspectors general that I met with once every two weeks as to make sure I could account for where every dollar went. What’s this president done? He’s fired every inspector general. We have no notion where the money’s going, except we know it’s not getting the people that deserve it. So that’s for number one. And getting the states and cities the essential money they need is critical. The pandemic slammed the states and we know what’s going on.\nJoe Biden: (01:12:15)\nWith regard to Joe’s question, and Joe, you talked about an awful lot. Right now, we’re all in mourning because John Lewis was the moral compass, has always knew where it pointed and which direction to march. His life reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make a promise of our nation real. And there’s so much work to be done. Our country is really in an anguish and anger over the systemic racism that still infects every part of our society. Brown, black, the whole communities of color bearing the brunt of every day of today’s crisis, just as they have from the time, as you said, Joe, from 400 years past. This has to be a wake up call for our nation, a call to action. It’s long past time for us to fully confront systemic racism and our growing economic inequity, to deal with the denial of our nation’s promise for so many, for so long.\nJoe Biden: (01:13:20)\nSo as president, I’m going to fight every day to lead some of those changes and I’m going to listen. I laid out an initial steps that Congress should be taken immediately to deal with police reform, to hold all police to a high standard, because most of them meet the standard. Those who don’t should be held accountable. I’m going to invest in shifting our criminal focus from incarceration to prevention, ending cash bail, diverting drug offenders to rehabilitation. I set up drug courts. That’s where they should be going to mandatory rehab instead of going into prison.\nJoe Biden: (01:13:49)\nWe need to do a lot more. We need a lot more than police and criminal justice reform if we’re going to address the systemic racism to help level out these inequities. I’m going to fight to end the deadly health inequities that COVID has amplified. Expand Obamacare with a public health option, meaning a Medicare option for the fastest path to universal care. I’m going to double the funding for community health care centers and the vital frontline workers. I’m going to make all coronavirus treatment and vaccines free for everyone. It’s necessary. We’re going to fight to give every child the same strong start in life. I’m going to make sure that Title I schools, the poor school districts, provide pre-K for everybody. You close the gap between rich and poor schools by tripling that funding from $15 to $45 billion a year. Make public colleges free for any family earning less than $125,000 a year. Modernize our broken immigration system. I’m going to send legislation on immigration reform to Congress on day one, providing a roadmap to citizens for the 11 million undocumented folks we have in this country that make our community so much stronger. I’m going to keep families together.\nJoe Biden: (01:15:01)\nThat’s the essence of my whole notion, dealing with… You’re trying to tell me I’m supposed to stop, but I have more to say here. Above all, any lasting change has to include genuine economic justice. And until we close the racial wealth and income gaps, we’re never going to realize our promises as a nation. Unions are the key to supporting better wages, benefits, and working conditions.\nHelen Esposito : (01:15:26)\n[inaudible 01:15:29].\nJoe Biden: (01:15:28)\nThey really are. Let me remind you why Dr. King was in Memphis on the day he was assassinated. He was there to stand with sanitation workers. That’s why he was there. People forget it. It’s about their dignity. It’s about who they were as human beings. I got the Dr. King award. I went to Memphis to his room. It’s exactly like it was the day he got shot. Exactly the same coffee cups, everything. He was an incredible man. He fought for economic justice. A fight for worker power and a fight for racial equality is all one fight.\nHelen Esposito : (01:16:05)\nThat’s right.\nJoe Biden: (01:16:06)\nI’m not only going to defend workers’ rights to organize. I’m going to encourage collective bargaining. As I said, I’ll ban right to work laws, get rid of noncompete agreements, fight for equal pay and sick leave and overtime pay. Boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour, benefiting workers. There’s so much we can do. And we finally have the public with us.\nJoe Biden: (01:16:28)\nMary Kay’s heard me say this. I was up in Massachusetts and I was with… the ShopRite was trying to reduce the pay in healthcare after they made $4 billion, their parent company for the union. And I wanted to ask them to go up there and speak. And so I spoke, I’m standing there and there’s about 600 to 800 people in the parking lot of this place. And I found out that somewhere between 70% to 80% weren’t union members, they were hourly workers who realize the only reason they have the rights they have is because of unions. So it’s a different thing. Chambers of commerce have been working and make unions the boogeyman for everybody.\nJoe Biden: (01:17:16)\nAnd we actually had hourly workers that then support us. Now they understand the circumstance has changed. It’s changed. So we’re going to be in a position to fundamentally change the ability of people to be able to make a decent wage, to be treated with dignity. It’s a beginning. Then the last thing I’ll point out is that we desperately need to increase the opportunity for black folks and brown folks and Asians, the AAPI folks to be able to be entrepreneurs themselves. It to be that they thought they couldn’t do as well.\nJoe Biden: (01:17:56)\nAll the data shows they are just as good as entrepreneurs as anyone else. But guess what? They can’t get the loans. So I’m going to double the amount of money, state and local, small businesses have to provide entrepreneurial loans to people. And I’m bringing billions of dollars off the sidelines. Secondly, we’re going to make sure that you think about this, how we work it. We have a circumstance where Joe, if you and I buy the same home built by the same builder in two different neighbors at either side of the highway, with exact same home, exact same lot. We both move in. The day we move in, if you live in a predominantly black neighborhood and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood, my home is valued at 23% higher than your home. Same exact home, same material, same everything.\nJoe Biden: (01:18:52)\nIf in fact black homes were valued at the same price that white homes of similar nature were valued because they’re not in black neighborhoods, it would increase by $158 billion the wealth in the pocket of African American families. Just to give you an example. We have to make sure that there’s access. That’s why I think every new homeowner in these times should get a $15,000 tax credit. A $15,000 tax credit, which is a down payment to be able to go out and buy a home. That’s how we’re going to increase hundreds of millions of dollars in rental housing that’s available to people. No one should pay more than 30% of their income for housing. But point of all this is I’m not just spending the money. All the economic experts point out how much money that pours back into the economy, how much more money that provides for people, how it grows the gross domestic product, how we all benefit.\nJoe Biden: (01:19:53)\nIt’s time we start thinking wisely and you can’t do it unless we bring along everybody. Look, I just want to say thanks. And Mary Kay, as you know I get awfully passionate about a lot of this, but this is in our wheel house. We can do this, but folks, it’s not just enough to elect me president. You got to go out and up and down the ticket. We got to elect a democratic Senate. We got increased the number of members of the House of Representatives for Democrats. We’re going to need the help. It matters who your mayor is. It matters who your county executive is. It matters who your local officials.\nJoe Biden: (01:20:36)\nAs John Lewis, who was a friend of mine, said, “The most powerful tool we have is to vote.” To vote, to vote, to vote. I want to thank Mary Kay and the union for the endorsement you gave me. But I also want to strongly encourage you. This is a chance in a lifetime we have here. It would be called an inflection point, particularly on race. Back when I was a kid in high school, Will Connor and his dogs would [inaudible 01:21:06] those lovely elderly ladies going to church in their Sunday best dress with little kids. And he [inaudible 01:21:14] their dogs on them and fire hoses, ripping the skin off of them. You know what happened? What happened was the rest of the country who didn’t have black populations heard this happened. All of a sudden, they saw it on black and white TV screens. And you know what Dr. King said? They thought Will Connor and the segregation [inaudible 01:21:33] putting a wooden stake in the heart of the Civil Right Movement. And he pointed out, they generated the second emancipation, the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act. It passed because people said, oh my God, it really happens. I don’t have my cell phone on me, but that cell phone, with millions all across America, were not for that 15 or 16 year old kid who for eight minutes and 46 seconds taped what happened to George Floyd, people didn’t believe it. They didn’t think those things really happened, but now they saw it. They saw it clearly. They saw his nose pressed up against that curb. How many times he said, “I can’t breathe.” How many times he called for his mama. His mama.\nJoe Biden: (01:22:19)\nAnd they saw it, and now they’re tired. You have 78% of white folks out there saying that black lives matter. Black lives matter. I had a neighbor who’s a Republican, not across the little pond I live on, and put up a sign on their property so I could see it. Black lives matter. This is a time to take advantage of what we have. Let’s not miss it, but you got to vote. You’ve got to vote.\nMary Kay Henry: (01:22:52)\nWe agree with you, Mr. Vice President. This is our time. We are committed to build back better with you and end systemic racism in America once and for all, and to check corporate power by building union power. So we look forward to doing that with you. Thank you for seeing caregivers. Thank you for seeing and hearing each of our stories. And we are going to go get our texting, our phoning, our virtual turnout, and show up and vote in numbers like never before. Thank you so much for listening to us today.\nJoe Biden: (01:23:29)\nWell, thanks so much [inaudible 01:23:32].\nMary Kay Henry: (01:23:30)\nThanks to Amber and to Marlin and [inaudible 01:23:34] and Joe and Helen and Adrianna and Peggy, thank you so much for your leadership on behalf of millions of servicing care workers.\nJoe Biden: (01:23:43)\nWell, let me tell you something [crosstalk 01:23:45]. Last comment I’ll make. If every hedge fund manager quit tomorrow, we’d still survive. If all of a sudden, every single person in your union went on strike, America could not survive. No, I’m not joking.\nHelen Esposito : (01:24:04)\nThat’s true.\nJoe Biden: (01:24:05)\nIf everybody in the IBW decided they’re not going to work tomorrow, guess what? And by the way, you were talking about when your basement floods and because you’re home with your kid, that kind of thing. Well, make sure you do something that I bet you haven’t done. Remember, when that person out there clearing out that sewer to keep your basement flood more, go say thank you. Thank them.\nSpeaker 9: (01:24:32)\nOf course.\nJoe Biden: (01:24:35)\nThink about it. We don’t thank people enough. Even those of us and even those of you were working like hell. Think about how many times we don’t thank people. It matters. It matters.\nHelen Esposito : (01:24:49)\nAlways thank.\nJoe Biden: (01:24:51)\nThank all of you. Appreciate it. Mary Kay. I love you. Thanks.\nMary Kay Henry: (01:24:54)\nLove you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. Thanks to all of our incredible leaders. Thank you for your leadership.\nJoe Biden: (01:25:00)\nThanks.', 'Donald Trump: (00:10)\nWell, thank you very much, Minnesota. There was supposed to only have like a hundred people. You know, we’re supposed to have these tiny little crowds. You can’t have any more than that. It’s very heavily restricted. That’s a lot of people showed up. I want to thank you. We’d love to have those rallies, but I guess you just can’t do that. And you’re not allowed to do that now. So we don’t do that, but we do the little airport hops and people like them and a lot of people come back. But unfortunately we had to hold off a lot of people in the back, which I feel badly about. In 78 days, we’re going to be. 78 days. We’re going to win this state. We’re going to take back the White House and we’re going to have an election that’s all about the survival, our nation.\nDonald Trump: (00:56)\nThis is a very important, in my opinion, I used to say 2016. And I must tell you, I think this is going to be the most important election in the history of our country. This is a very, very big deal going on. Joe Biden is the puppet of left wing extremists, trying to erase our borders, eliminate our police, indoctrinate our children, vilify our heroes, take away our energy. You know all about that. Take away our energy. If you can believe it. No fossil fuel. Destroy our second amendment, attack the right to life and replace American freedom with left wing fascism. Left wing. We’re going to left wing all the way. Fascists. They are fascists. Some of them, not all of them, but some of them, but they’re getting closer and closer. We have to win this election, but the proud people of Minnesota will not let this happen.\nDonald Trump: (01:52)\nYou will deliver a historic victory for our values, our citizens and our treasured way of life. We’ll save our cities in our suburbs from the future of crime and chaos, corruption, and economic collapse that puppet Joe Biden would unleash on America. This is a puppet. He won’t do it intentionally. He just says, “Well, whatever they want.” Because he has no clue. He has no clue.\nDonald Trump: (02:20)\nI ended low income housing being built in the suburbs and destroying people’s American dream. You know that. If Biden and Harris get into power, they’ve pledged to raise your taxes by $4 trillion, which put in very simple terms, mean many of you will have to pay double and triple the taxes that you’re paying right now. This includes attacks of over $3,000 on a typical family of four. Biden Harris also pledged to eliminate fracking, natural gas, oil, and coal production. Forcing us to beg for energy from foreign suppliers. On my watch, America will proudly remain energy independent. First time, energy independent. We’ve met a lot of progress on energy.\nDonald Trump: (03:19)\nI want to thank your terrific representatives in Congress, Tom Emmer. Where’s Tom? Tom, Tom, Tom.\nTom Emmer: (03:30)\nRight here.\nDonald Trump: (03:30)\nThere he is, what a man. These are warriors. Jim Hagedorn. Pete Stauber.\nDonald Trump: (03:42)\nAnd this is a very important one, fellows. This is very important. Your next senator from Minnesota. Fantastic man. I just see that he’s even in the poll. Normally that doesn’t mean much, but that’s a big step and he’s fantastic. Jason Lewis, he’s going to be a fantastic senator. That’s big, Jason. That’s ahead of schedule. And I hear we’re doing very well in the poll too. We win Minnesota, it is over. It is over, right? We win Minnesota. But our great Republican candidates for Congress, Michelle Fischbach. Where’s Michelle? Michelle? I hear so many great things about you. I have heard so many great things. Go out and do it. You’re going to do it. We’re going to be out there working with you. Tyler Kistner. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Good luck, Tyler.\nDonald Trump: (04:38)\nIt’s a great group. And man whose name I love, Lacy Johnson. Great job. I’ve been following you, Lacy. You’re doing good. You’re doing good. Thank you, Lacy very much. We really have to get them. They’re warriors, all of them, all of them. We have to get them in because we have to stop this craziness that’s going on. No law enforcement, no anything. They don’t know what they’re doing. They’ll lose the country. You know, there’s somebody said the other day and I say it very strongly, “Sir, you’re the only one between that and the greatness of the American dream.” And there’s truth to it. We don’t stop. We don’t keep this position. We’re going to win the House. I feel confident we’re going to win the House.\nDonald Trump: (05:28)\nWe are going to win the House. I’m very much involved in every single race and with the Senate, we’re working very hard. I think we’re going to be in great shape in the Senate. And I think we’re a great, did you see that CNN, they raised us 10 points in one poll that took place over a short period of time? And it’s still not good enough. It’s still not good enough. You mean they’re getting more honest because I’ll tell you what, there’s never been enthusiasm like we have. There’s never been. Right, Tom? Including in 2016, we’ve never had. We had more enthusiasm than anyone’s seen maybe ever in a presidential campaign and it pales in comparison to what’s going on right now. It does.\nDonald Trump: (06:16)\nEven this, we wanted to restrict the crowd. We didn’t tell anybody and look at what happens. But look at Voters for Trump. Look at Bikers for Trump. They have highways with thousands of people, thousands of people, right? You know, bikers going, I don’t know if I’m driving along and I get passed by 2,000 bikers, I don’t know what I’m going to do. And then they have, they set Guinness book, I hear, the world record yesterday for boats. But no matter where you… In Florida, no matter where you go, a river, a lake, an ocean, there’re boats up there by the thousands on the wicker. The weekend is unbelievable. Minnesota Senate majority leader, Paul Gazelka. Paul. Thank you, Paul. Good job, Paul. Are we doing good? We’re doing good. Right? I think we are too. And Minnesota House Republican leader. Another great one. Kurt Daudt. Kurt, thank you very much. Thank you, Kurt, very much.\nDonald Trump: (07:15)\nI’m having a lot of fun today because it’s so windy. You can’t see these teleprompters at all. So I’m sort of making it up as I go along and that’s okay. I’ve had to do that plenty. Now these suckers are blowing, like I’m saying “What that hell?” Fortunately, I know these people. If I didn’t know these people, you would have been in big trouble. I will tell you that. Another one I know very well, he’s the single greatest ad buyer in the history of the world. And he also happens to make a very good product. His pillow. I use it. When I sleep well, I’m using his pillow and these suckers are about to fall down, but that’s okay because I know him very well. Mike Lindell.\nDonald Trump: (08:00)\nMike, thank you. And he’s the chairman of our campaign. If I don’t win Minnesota with you as the chairman of our campaign, I would say that would be very bad for me because if this guy can do anything, thank you, Mike. It’s an honor and we appreciate it very much. Thank you. You do a great job. Thank you. And it’s all made in Minnesota, right? All made in Minnesota. Thank you very much. Before the China virus invaded our shores, we built the greatest economy in history. There was nothing like it. We were beating everybody, including China. They had the worst year in 67 years. We were taking in billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. Beautiful thing tariffs, when used properly, especially when you’re being taken advantage of by every nation of the world. We achieved record low unemployment for African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, young people, people with diplomas, people without diplomas, college students, crummy students, great students, horrible students, dumb people, liberal people, conservative people.\nDonald Trump: (09:17)\nEverybody was doing the best they’ve ever done. PhDs from MIT. PhDs from crummy colleges. Everybody was doing the greatest, the best they’ve ever done. Median household income soared to the highest level ever recorded. Numbers were unbelievable to open new opportunities for Minnesota farmers and factory workers. We replaced the disaster known as NAFTA with a brand new USMCA, which has been a big hit. Dairy exports to Canada are now expected to surge by at least 50%. I know how good the deal is. Don’t tell Canada I said this because they were not happy about it. They had pickets. When they have pickets about a deal, that makes you feel good. But they’ve been taking advantage. You know, Canada. Oh, Canada. Wonderful song. Right? Oh, Canada. Nice, nice song. Only one problem. They took advantage of us like crazy with your dairy tariffs, 297% tariff on your dairy products, right?\nDonald Trump: (10:31)\nI learned that when I came up here, they had specialty milk, a little thing, specialty milk. And I met a farmer and he said what had happened with specialty milk. And that got me over the edge. And I said, “We got to change this,” because you were taken, Tom. You were taken advantage of by Canada very badly and by Mexico and by China and by Japan and by friends and foe. And in many cases, friends who are worse than the foe. For years, you watched as politicians like Sleepy Joe Biden who’s been in office for 47 years, allowed foreign nations to crush Minnesota’s mining. Look at your mining industry, it was crushed by dumping tons and tons of cheap iron and steel into our country. I saw what was happening. I did something about it. I did something about it.\nDonald Trump: (11:26)\nI will tell you, China wants me to lose so badly. They all do. They all do. And yet I get along with all of them. Although China I don’t speak to them. After the plague came in, you know, we made a great deal with China. They announced last week that China ordered the largest amount of corn in history and the largest amount of soybeans in history and big cattle purchases. One of the biggest anybody has seen. And I said, “See how smart they are? If they weren’t smart, they would’ve stopped and we would’ve said let’s decouple.” But by ordering so much, the farmers come to me, “Sir, we like this deal a lot. Please don’t do anything irrational.”\nDonald Trump: (12:08)\nHow smart is China? Right? The biggest corn order. Think. They said the biggest corn order in history. So I have to say, “Ah.” But I tell you, my view has changed a lot. We’ve made a great deal with China, but my view has changed a lot. USMCA is the biggest deal ever made. And that one is working out great between Canada and Mexico. And remember this, Minnesota, under the last administration, the last administration, Minnesota iron range was wiped out. Seven plants were idled and more than 2,000 workers were laid off. Obama and Biden closed it down. Do you remember that? The finest iron ore in the world, they say, I don’t know, what do I know? To me it all looks the same, but they say it’s the finest iron ore in the world. That’s good enough for me. And what did I do? Almost immediately after getting into office, I heard about this disaster, just like Keystone Pipeline, just like so much else, Jason. And you’ll be working on that with me and in the beautiful halls of the Senate. And he’s going to stay with us. He’s not going to be one of those that gets elected.\nDonald Trump: (13:27)\nHe’s not going to be one of them that get elected and then he walks into those gorgeous buildings when they had those big, beautiful dollar bills and they built marble columns. And it’s so beautiful. And so rich, he’s not going to say, “Darling, we finally arrived. Now we can go with majority.” He’s going to do what’s right. He’s going to do what’s right. I know Jason, you need Jason, get Jason elected please. But they closed it up. And I was here and a worker. I was making speeches before you had to stand 200 feet away from everybody, before you had to stand like two football fields away. And a worker came up to me with a group of his friends and they were all crying and they were tough. They never cried before in their life. Maybe when they were babies but I doubt it.\nDonald Trump: (14:14)\nThey were all crying. He said, “Sir, you gave us back our life.” He said that. I had that just recently in Maine, they took away 5,000 square miles. Think of a square mile and then multiply it times 5,000. Took away 5,000 square miles. That was, O-Biden. As I call them, O-Biden. That was Obama and Biden short. I like that term. O-Biden, because you save a lot of time, but that was Obama and Biden in Maine took away 5,000, Mike, square miles. You know what that is? That’s like I said, “Let me see what it looks like on a map.” They basically took away the Atlantic ocean from Maine. And Maine is the greatest in the world for lobster and the greatest in the world, just about, for fishing. I said, “Why did he take this area?”\nDonald Trump: (15:07)\nThey didn’t know, except that was the great fishing area. And I gave it back to them. I redid it. I took it off. I wiped it out. I gave an executive order that wiped it out immediately. Then we wiped out the tariffs that they were being charged by China. And by, as you know, the United Kingdom was charging tariffs. They were all charging tariffs to our fishermen, but we don’t charge tariffs to them. So I made it. I made it fair. European Union was a disaster charging tariffs. They were charging big tariffs. We wouldn’t. So here’s what was happening. So Canada, they would sell the fish and lobster to Canada for nothing, for peanuts and Canada would then sell it to China and also to the European Union, because Canada had a deal where they didn’t have to pay the tariffs. This was before my time, how this could’ve happened is a…\nDonald Trump: (16:03)\nThey didn’t have to pay the tariffs. This was before my time. How this could have happened is incredible. So I said, “Listen, if you don’t change your tariffs, I’m going to put your tariffs on your car.” It was amazing. They said, “We’ll change them immediately.” Thank you very much. That took about two minutes. So I did a lot for Maine. We’re going to see whether or not they remember but I think Maine’s going to remember but I did similar for you when I opened up your great iron ore and I put tariffs, I put tariffs on foreign steel and the Iron Range came roaring back to life. You know that, right? Right?\nDonald Trump: (16:35)\nThese guys came up to me, “You’ve given us back our life.” I’ve never forgotten that, “You’ve given us back our life.” They didn’t say thanks, they didn’t say thanks for the job, they said that’s what they’ve done all their life and Obama just came in and closed it up. I don’t say Biden because I don’t think he knows what the hell is happening. I think if you mention … IF you mention, “You shouldn’t have done that to Minnesota,” he’ll say, “Where’s Minnesota? [inaudible 00:16:58]. I don’t know what Minnesota is. Where is that please?”\nDonald Trump: (17:03)\nHow many times by the way has he been up at a speech where he’ll say the wrong state, right? He’ll get up, “It’s great to be in the wonderful state of Ohio.” “Sir, sir, you’re in Florida.” That’s the bad one, when you see palm trees. Wonderful to be in Ohio. Or, “I love being with the people from Iowa.” “Sir, you’re in Idaho.” He always gets New Hampshire mixed up with Vermont. But all the time he does that. I haven’t done it yet. If I do I’m just leaving because there’s no way you can save it. There’s no way you can save it.\nDonald Trump: (17:44)\nWe recently issued a directive protecting workers on the Iron Range from unfair job-killing regulation and frivolous litigation in addition to everything else. We started construction on the new soo lock, right? Soo lock, big deal. That’s been deteriorating for many years. Just about gone and we’re redoing it now, rebuilding it. That’s a big deal for your state and for others so that the iron ore can quickly get to market. Soo lock. Our miners are back on the job and wages have increased by as much as 50% and they’re doing great even during the China plague, they’re doing great and the China plague will fade but we will not forget. If Biden wins, the Iron Range will be shut down forever. You know that. He’ll shut it down very early on forever. I took a lot of heat by doing that. I took a lot of heat from the so-called environmentalists. I’m an environmentalist too in a big sense. We just signed something the every day. Cory Gardner, Steve Daines, senators, great senators, and we signed a bill that’s going to really be something incredible from an environmental standpoint, the biggest we’ve ever signed they say, other than Teddy Roosevelt. It goes back to Teddy Roosevelt. I said, “Why is [inaudible 00:19:09]?” Because we also did something tremendous for Utah, you know that. Thousands and thousands of acres, we opened it up. I said, “Why isn’t it bigger than Teddy Roosevelt? I want bigger. Otherwise I’m not signing,” they said, “Sir, he did the Grand Canyon and a few other things.” I said, “All right. That’s pretty big.” Grand Canyon is big. Do we agree? Even from Mike Lindell, the Grand Canyon. Even Mike would admit the Grand Canyon’s tough to beat, right? So anyway, but we did. We signed it and it’s one of the biggest acts. They say the biggest thing environmentally done since Teddy Roosevelt. That’s a long time ago.\nDonald Trump: (19:45)\nWe achieved together and what we’re doing together is nothing short of an economic miracle and now we’re doing it again. We did it, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now I have to do it again. You know what that is? That’s right, that’s God testing me. He said, “You know, you did it once,” and I said, “Did I do a great job, God? I’m the only one that could do it?” He said, “That you shouldn’t say. Now we’re going to have you do it again.” I said, “Okay, I agree. You got me.” But I did it once and now I’m doing it again and you see the kind of numbers that we’re putting up, they’re unbelievable. Best job numbers ever, three months, more jobs in the last three months than ever before. Best retail sales in history. Best car sales, did you see where the car sales are actually above what they were? Did you see the manufacturing, remember you’re not going to have manufacturing back. You needed a magic wand for manufacturing, well we got the magic wand because the manufacturing numbers are through the roof and your state, last year had the best year it ever had, right? Best year it ever had and now you’re going to have something that’s even better. So I just want to tell you, we are going to do it again.\nDonald Trump: (21:04)\nBy the way, third quarter numbers come out and interestingly they will come out just before November 1 and we’re going to see how I did but I think you’re going to have a great third quarter. People are now starting to predict it much to their chagrin, right? Much to their chagrin. [inaudible 00:21:20] just like CNN said, “He’s up 10 points.” They all said, “10 points? 10 points?” First of all, the first poll was rigged and wrong. It was a rigged poll, just like they want to try and rig the election with all these mail-in ballots. Let’s send out 62 million ballots. Let’s send … Well, some people say, “Gee, you shouldn’t talk.” I got to talk about it because absentee ballots are good. You send for the ballot, you’re not going to be in your state and you get it back and you do something and you send it back in and it’s a process. You have to work for it a little bit. But these ballots, they want to send them out in some states, they want to send them out and they want to just have millions of ballots, they say, “Oh, we drop them in a lockbox.”\nDonald Trump: (22:03)\nI just saw, the great thing about Air Force One, there’s no lack of television. You have televisions on the ceilings, in the closets, on the floors. No matter where you go, there’s a television. You open the closet, there’s a television. I say, “No, too much Trump. I can’t watch it anymore.” I try and get away, you put yourself in a closet. But they have a lot of stuff and they showed this person getting on FOX, you know FOX now puts on more Democrats just about than they do Republicans. They have certainly changed a lot. FOX has changed a lot. They’re probably turning off right now as I speak but I don’t … See I don’t care. I tell the truth. It’s ridiculous.\nDonald Trump: (22:41)\nOne of the biggest differences between this year and four years ago is FOX. FOX is like from a different planet, and too bad. And you know what’s going to happen? If we don’t win, they’re going to go down the tubes along with every other media outlet, they’ll all be bust, they’ll all be gone, I can tell you that. Nobody’s going to want to cover Sleepy Joe. We’ll end up with one very boring socialist country that will go to hell, but when you look at it and when you look at what’s happening, that’s why we have to win this election, and if we don’t win this election, every one of you, me, all of us, it will never be the country … I don’t think the country can ever come back to it.\nDonald Trump: (23:23)\nI used to use Venezuela a lot. I don’t know if I even really fully believed it but I’d say, “Venezuela, we would indeed become.” When I look at these maniacs in Portland, these anarchists in Portland, when I look at these people, that’s what they want for the rest of the country. They want to defund their police, they want to terminate their police. You know something about that. You’ve had your little stance where they want to … Did they actually do the, they actually are terminating the police department, right? They are actually doing it. They’re not even talking about it, they’re terminating the police department. These people are crazy, and by the way, when I sent in the National Guard, that’s when it all stopped and I kept calling. I kept calling and saying, “Send in the National Guard. Send in the National Guard.” They should have done it a lot sooner.\nDonald Trump: (24:16)\nThat was a beautiful … I just said, I just stopped some place else and I said, “To me it was a beautiful sight.” They were rioting all over, full of venom, vigor. They thought nobody was going to stop them. The police department is very good but they were told you can’t do anything. They have to be able to do what they do very well. So they were told they couldn’t do anything and the city was ablaze. It was ablaze. I’ll never forget the CNN reporter, he’s standing there with his very nice shaved head. Right now I wish I had a shaved head, it would be a good [inaudible 00:24:55] wind, but you know what? He’s standing there, [Velshi 00:24:59], right? Ali Velshi, and he’s standing there, “Things seem quite calm right now,” and behind him, they have the entire city looks like it’s burning down for blocks. He’s standing there talking because the fake news doesn’t report the truth and they don’t talk about how serious it is and how bad it is.\nDonald Trump: (25:18)\nBut remember this, it’s only a small part of our country. It’s not a big part, very small but they don’t report the facts because they don’t want to report those facts because those facts are very bad for Joe Biden and for the radical left and they want them to win. For whatever reason I don’t know because they’ll all lose their networks, they’ll all lose their wealth, everything will be gone but they’ll figure it out someday but we’re not going to let them have that chance. As much as in many ways they should not be rewarded, they’re going to be rewarded if I win because our country is only going up in one direction so that’s the way it is.\nDonald Trump: (25:54)\nTo fight the China virus, we’ve enacted the largest financial relief package in American history, through the Paycheck Protection Program we saved one million Minnesota jobs. We’ve also delivered nearly five billion dollars in economic relief straight to Minnesota families, you know that, we’ve kept it all going, and we’d like to do it again, except the Democrats, all they want is one trillion dollars, one trillion. They’re not interested in the people, they’re not interested in the Post Office. It’s all a ruse, it’s all a con. They’re only interested in getting a trillion dollars, you guys know that, getting a trillion dollars for states that are badly run blue states, very badly run by governors and mayors like New York, Illinois, California, I won’t name any more because to be honest, he’s going, “Minnesota, I don’t know.” I don’t like to be so personal but you do have some issues, I will say that. Of all places I would be very surprised, I was very surprised.\nDonald Trump: (26:57)\nUnlike Sleepy Joe Biden our approach to the pandemic is based on science, not left-wing ideology. Slow Joe opposed the travel ban on China that I instituted. Remember he came out, “Oh it’s xenophobic.” I said, “What does that mean Joe? Tell me Joe. Can you describe?” Remember he came out and he called me all sorts of things, a racist and everything and then he said I was right. I was early, way, way early. We would have lost hundreds of thousands of additional lives and that’s pretty much agreed by everybody. Then I put the ban on Europe coming in because they were ahead of us and when I looked at Italy and I looked at France and Spain I said, “We got to put it on,” and a lot of people didn’t want that, they said we were right about that, and then we started getting into the manufacturing business with the ventilators and all of the equipment and what we did is incredible. The governors were not prepared. We made a lot of governors look good by supplying massive amounts of equipment. Massive. Not one person in this country, we didn’t have very many ventilators at all. Way under-supplied. Not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn’t get the ventilators so every single person that needed one got one which is pretty amazing.\nDonald Trump: (28:14)\nWe have a big country with a lot of diversity, a lot of different states, and now we’re supplying, we’re making thousands of ventilators a month and we’re supplying them to the rest of the word because they’re not equipped to make a ventilator. It’s very complex, very expensive. We’re making thousands a month, we have all we can use.\nDonald Trump: (28:32)\nNow Biden wants to lock all Americans in their basement for months on end which would inflict permanent irreversible harm on our nation’s children, families, health and economy. By contrast my administration is following data-driven and science-based approaches that apply to common sense mitigation, aggressively sheltering those at greatest risk, our seniors, we have to shelter them, and deliver effective medical treatments to save thousands and thousands of lives and when you look at the rest of the world, you know they were trying to say, “Oh, we weren’t doing that.” Now all of a sudden a lot of the places that they were using to hold up, they’re having a big surge, and I don’t want that, I don’t want that, but they were holding up names of countries and now they’re saying, “Whoops.” In fact, even New Zealand, you see what’s going on in New Zealand? They beat it, they beat it. It was like front page, they beat it because they wanted to show me something. The problem is, big surge in New Zealand. So you know, it’s terrible. We don’t want that but this is an invisible enemy that should have never been let to come to this country, to Europe or the rest of the world by China. Just remember it. Just remember it. [inaudible 00:29:46]\nDonald Trump: (29:48)\nThe fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by 85% since April. We’ve learned, we know, we have some great things now too. Europe by contrast has experienced a 40% higher rate of excess mortality than the United States. Think about that, you don’t hear those stories, they don’t tell you that Tom, do they? You don’t hear that in Congress, right? We launched the largest mobilization of American goods since the World War II. Think of it, since World War II. This is the largest mobilization since World War II, creating the most advanced testing system in the world, producing thousands of ventilators and launching Operation Warp Speed to deliver and distribute a vaccine before the end of the year in record time. We’re at a very, very close point to the vaccine and to therapeutics and therapeutics to me are more important right now. You go into the hospital, whether it’s a transfusion or whether it’s a shot and you feel better two days later or a day later or three days later but now would be a great thing and we’re very close, we have great, great companies working on it.\nDonald Trump: (31:01)\nBecause we will defeat the China virus, we’re going to be stronger than we ever were. Next year is going to be record setting numbers and you see that when you look at the V. The V is turning out to be true. I was saying a V and everybody was saying a V is impossible but the V, it’s beyond a V, it’s a super V based on the numbers that we have now. So we’ll see what happens and we would like to give additional money to people. We would like to … It wasn’t their fault that they got hit by China but you know what? We want to give them additional money and we’ll take care of … Again, the Post Office has been a disaster for many, many decades. We want to strengthen the Post Office, make it good. It lost $78 billion over a relatively short number of years. $78 billion, I want to strengthen the Post Office and we can do it so that if you look, Amazon and all these companies that now do, it’s a whole new business, they just drop a lot of it right into the Post Office and we lose two and three –\nDonald Trump: (32:03)\n… just drop a lot of it right into the post office, and we lose two and $3 every time we deliver a package. What’s that all about? And he gets richer, and they get richer. How smart is that? For every package they deliver, it’s two and $3 a package. So why aren’t they raising the prices to Amazon and to these companies that are making all this money? Instead, we pay for it, and they always seem to open their distribution facilities right next to a post office.\nDonald Trump: (32:29)\nSo they take a lot of the goods that they can’t distribute, because the post office is massive, much bigger than those companies, believe it or not, you wouldn’t think it, but much, much bigger. And they go to areas of Minnesota, and other states that you can’t reach, you’ll never reach, and they just dump thousands of packages into the post office and they say, “Good luck. Here’s your $2. Here’s your $1. Here’s your 52 cents.” Now we got to do that. So that’s my opinion. What do I know about delivery? What do I know? That’s my opinion. That’s a new business, but we’re being taken advantage of by all of those companies, and they should pay, not the people.\nDonald Trump: (33:10)\nMy administration also understands that economic health is vital to public health. Over the past three months, we’ve gained nine million jobs nationwide, which is a new record. Retail spending is fully recovered and is now at an all-time high. We have more retail spending now than we did before the plague came in from China. Auto-production surge, 28%. Joe Biden would crush this unprecedented economic recovery. During his 47 years in Washington, think of that, 47 years, Joe Biden. And it’s really amazing, for 47 years, he did nothing, now he’s telling everybody how he’s going to make it wonderful, right? It doesn’t work that way, and he’s not exactly prime time now either, by the way.\nDonald Trump: (33:58)\nJoe Biden supported every globalist attack on the American worker, NAFTA, which was a disaster, TPP, which I didn’t allow to happen, the horrible Korea deal. South China’s entry into the World Trade Organization might’ve been the worst of them all, it created China. Now Biden is running on the most extreme far-left agenda ever put forward by a major party. Biden’s joint manifesto, we call it a manifesto, with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, would raise taxes and increase regulations at an unprecedented rate. He will kill the stock market, he will kill everything that we’re talking about today. He’d also abolish immigration enforcement, abolish bail, abolish the suburbs, abolish effective policing, abolish American energy, and abolish the American way of life, otherwise, he’d do quite a good job, I think.\nDonald Trump: (34:57)\nHe raised his hand and pledged to give free healthcare to illegal aliens, okay? A lot of you people, you don’t get free healthcare, but he wants to give it. He wants to give lawyers, free legal assistance to people that come into our country illegally, and his vice-presidential candidate, Biden picked Kamala, Kamala Harris. She’s [inaudible 00:03:22], she’s a beauty, who co-sponsored a $32 trillion socialist takeover of healthcare and our country, because our country would be ruined, destroyed. And think of this, you have 33 in healthcare and $93 trillion on the socialist Green New Deal, which doesn’t work. It’s like written by a child. It’s written by a child, a foolish child. It’s written by a foolish child.\nDonald Trump: (35:55)\nI have a very different vision for America’s future, you got to see it before the plague, but you’re seeing it again right now, even more so. It starts with creating 10 million jobs in the next 10 months, and that’s what’s happening. Over the next four years, we will cut even more taxes, substantially, and regulations. That’s why people are pouring into our country to open up factories, they’re bringing them back to Minnesota and every place else. In Michigan, we have auto plants opening up left and right, and expanding. They haven’t seen that in 42 years. We will end our reliance on China. We will make our critical drugs and supplies right here in the United States.\nDonald Trump: (36:42)\nAnd when you see the drug companies, they’re very rich, very sophisticated, when you see them taking the ads against Donald Trump, those ads are for one reason, because I’m bringing your drug prices way down, I instituted a favored nations clause. So if Germany, or any place, anywhere in the world is getting their drugs for less, which they do, a tiny fraction of what we pay, they have to meet those prices. Somebody should’ve done this. Obama, Biden, other presidents should’ve done this. Our drug prices are many times higher than other countries. Many, many times. In Canada, the price is half and better than that, and I gave Florida, Ron DeSantis, a great governor, gave him the right to buy his drugs directly from Canada. He’s going to save half. So right now you can’t do that. I gave him and I gave another state, Colorado, the authority to, if they want, they could go buy, prior to the favored nations kicking in.\nDonald Trump: (37:43)\nBut the favored nations clause could reduce drugs by 50, 60, 70, even 80%. Think of that one. And I’m the only president in 51 years, that had a year, last year, where drug prices came down, but that was peanut stuff compared to what I’m talking about. So when you see those ads, if you don’t mind, and you see the drug companies hitting me, you’ll say, “Thank you, President Trump for reducing drug prices.” I guarantee you, if they were going up, they wouldn’t be taking ads. It makes sense, I guess, right? I hope people understand that, because they are spending a lot of money. They don’t like me. I did something that was unthinkable.\nDonald Trump: (38:26)\nCheck out the words, favored nation, check out the word rebate, because now I take the rebate for the people and I take the rebate to reduce the prices. They took the rebate, went to a middleman. The middleman, I never heard the term middlewoman, but I guess probably that too. But the middleman got all this money, I don’t know who they are, nobody knows who they are. The middlemen, you always hear it, they made more money than the drug companies. At least the drug companies made a product, but the middleman is not liking Donald Trump too much. I probably have a lot of friends that are middlemen. I don’t even know if they have beautiful homes. I say, I wonder where they made their money? They’re very wealthy, but they’re not so wealthy anymore.\nDonald Trump: (39:07)\nWe are getting the rebates. We’re keeping the money for our people. We will create tax credits for companies that bring jobs from China back to America, and we’ll impose tariffs on companies that leave America to produce jobs overseas. One of the things in the USMCA that was very important, I don’t want our companies going to Mexico, going to Canada anymore. I watched that. I was man of the year, 11 years ago in Michigan. I don’t know why, but they picked me. That was long before I thought in terms of running. Are we glad I ran?\nSpeaker 1: (39:41)\nYeah.\nDonald Trump: (39:42)\nI think so. I think so. What do you think? Yes? I think so. But that was long before I thought about this, Mike, and I was in Michigan, very nice, man of the year, that was great, and I said, “They’re taking your car companies and moving them all to Mexico.” Anyway, 32% of our cars are made in Mexico. How crazy? But it’s that way, that’s the way it happened. But I said, the most important deal in the USMCA, I don’t want anybody moving to Mexico, firing their people, moving there, making a car, selling it in for no tax. I don’t want that anymore, can’t happen, and that’s not going to happen. There is such a huge economic disincentive to do that.\nDonald Trump: (40:24)\nSo we’ll strip federal contracts from companies that outsource critical industries, we’re going to strip it. With the help of Minnesota workers, we will be the premier medical and pharmaceutical manufacturer anywhere in the world, and you see it already. The drug companies are starting to give up. Now, I’ll tell you, if for some reason, the other side happens to have a victory on November 3rd, forget everything I said. It’ll all be made in China Plus, it’ll all be made in other countries like Vietnam, and other places. And you can just forget everything I said, because they’re typical politicians, but radical left wing. They will go right back to it, but even more so.\nDonald Trump: (41:08)\nTo protect our families and workers during the China pandemic, I sealed our border against illegal immigration, and suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs. And yet, if you’re a farmer, a factory owner and you had people coming in from years, we made it easier for those people to keep coming in. I can’t shut them off, you’d have to close up your businesses. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has pledged to allow virtually unlimited immigration during a global pandemic, spreading the virus, overwhelming our healthcare system, and displacing millions of American job seekers. The Biden plan would institute catch and release, I got rid of it, along the entire Southwest border. This is where you catch perhaps a murderer, perhaps a rapist. You catch somebody, you take their number and you release them. You say, “Please show up to court in three years,” nobody shows up. 1% show up. You know who the 1% are? The ones that aren’t very smart. They’re the ones that show up, they’re the only ones that show up.\nDonald Trump: (42:17)\nSo we’ve built almost 300 miles of border wall and we’re adding 10 new miles each way, and if we didn’t have that, we’d be in trouble because sadly… And the President of Mexico is a friend of mine, he’s a great guy, Lacy, he’s a great guy like you, but I said to him, “We have to do this, and in the meantime, you have to give us a lot of troops along our border, because we’re paying you a lot of money with your cars, and otherwise I’m going to have to tariff.” And he said, “No, no, no. We will give you troops.” We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border. Nobody’s coming through unless we want them to. We have to come in legally into our country on the Southern border and elsewhere. We have 27,000 troops. You didn’t even know that, Tom, 27,000.\nDonald Trump: (43:07)\nFurthermore, Joe Biden has pledged to increase refugee resettlement by not a bad number, 700%. You read that, right? That’s in the manifesto. He would overwhelm Minnesota with refugees, from terror hotspots, depleting public services, burdening schools, and straining city budgets. You already know about the hotspots, don’t you? You know about it. You’re having plenty of problems in Minnesota. And I’m going to be so politically correct, I’m not going to say a thing, but I know all about your hotspots, you got some hotspots. Very unfair to Minnesota, I will tell you that. And I’ll tell you, if I don’t win Minnesota, I’m never going to do it if I run for a third or fourth term, okay? I’ll never be back if I run, I’ve given up. I almost won last time. One more speech, Mike? almost won. I went to Michigan, I had a choice. I shouldn’t tell you this, but we won Michigan. One more speech, I would’ve won. I was so close, but if I don’t win it this time, I’m not coming back, never. Not for term three, four, five, or six.\nDonald Trump: (44:16)\nUnder my administration, we’ve dramatically reduced refugee resettlement and we’ve suspended refugee resettlement during the pandemic, you know that we’ve totally suspended it, nobody comes in. Lucky we have the wall, we’re up to 300 miles almost. If we didn’t have that wall, we would be inundated with people and unfortunately, and we’re helping them, we sent them a lot of ventilators and other equipment, but Mexico is being overrun with the pandemic and we would really have a problem. We’ve completely reformed refugee policy. We’ve instituted rigorous national security checks. We protected religious minorities, and we’ve shifted refugee admissions away from terror afflicted nations, like Syria, and Somalia.\nDonald Trump: (45:09)\nAnd remember, they say we don’t have it, we do have it. They understand that, they just don’t want to say it. We have a ban, you know that. We have a ban on people coming into our country illegally, we have a ban on countries, because we want people to come into our country who love our country, who can love our country, who respect our country, and who are going to come in on merit, merit, merit, which is the exact opposite of what was happening. Many of them hated our country and they didn’t come in on merit. All they do is complain. Do you know anybody like that? They just complain. Does anybody know anybody like that? Do you know anybody? One of your colleagues? You call her a colleague? All she does is complain. I won’t mention the name, because you’ll never guess, complains, complains, complains. I don’t like that. I don’t like it. All she does is complain, “Not good enough!” Oh really? Tell us about it.\nDonald Trump: (46:07)\nTo protect our security, my administration instituted a travel ban on the world’s most dangerous regions. Biden has pledged to immediately end this travel ban and allow unlimited migration from terror zones, including Syria, Somalia, Libya, Iran, and Yemen. Trouble, trouble. I also kept the promise I made to Minnesota four years ago. I signed an executive order requiring state and local consent before any refugees are admitted. Biden would immediately shred that executive order, overriding local communities like yours, you know that. Did you know I signed that? You have to give approval now. Little different than the old days, isn’t it, huh? A little bit different. The old days was a lot different, and I signed that approval. They have to go through a process now, and you have to approve it. Why should we send everybody up to Minnesota or any place else?\nDonald Trump: (47:12)\nIn recent weeks, Democrat-controlled cities have shown the Democrats’ plan and what they plan for America. In Minneapolis, 700 buildings were burned, damaged, or destroyed, costing more than $1 billion. I just left, incredible people. We were on a runway like this, and I introduced them. Their businesses were burned down, gone, and they don’t know what they’re going to do, but we’re going to try helping them to get them rebuilt. But five groups of people that were just incredible people, successful, wonderful people, their stores and businesses were burned down, destroyed. Dozens of business owners have announced they are considering moving hundreds of jobs out of Democrat run Minneapolis, you know that. You know that. Criminals are terrorizing civilians in-\nDonald Trump: (48:03)\nYou know that, criminals are terrorizing civilians in Chicago, Portland, and now New York City. This radical left Mayor de Blasio has let our beautiful diamond, I loved it, I left it four years ago. I could see there were the seeds of problems. He was there, but I left and it was wonderful. Four years ago I left it, and over the last year, especially over the last six months, crime has gone up hundreds of percentage points, hundreds. 273 points, 368 points. Numbers that you wouldn’t believe. And we’re talking about shootings, murders, you saw what happened this weekend. You saw that, Jason. Terrible. My city, I love that city, but it has great potential and we’re going to do something. We’re going to do something strong. They just let it go to hell and I don’t know is it because they’re bad people or they have no common sense, or they just don’t know what they’re doing? But our beautiful diamond, of this country, has been let go to hell.\nDonald Trump: (49:06)\nTop Democrats have demanded the defunding of police departments. Biden even referred to the police at the enemy. And that’s what it is. He’s not going to control… look, he’s not going to control the situation. He’s dealing with… how about the congress woman that I watched over weekend, right? Saying, “I have total control over Biden. He’ll do anything I say. I have total control.” What she’s saying is, “I have total control over this jerk. He’ll do whatever the hell I want.” That’s putting it in more common language. But she said just as mean as that.\nDonald Trump: (49:42)\nYou know who I’m talking about, right? You saw that? What a horrible statement to make and frankly Kamala, nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kamala. I mean, nobody. He was called a racist and just about everything else under the book. Then all of a sudden she saying, “He’s such a fine man.” Look nobody treated him, including Pocahontas, nobody on the debate stage, nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kamala Harris and she’s got some big issues.\nDonald Trump: (50:15)\nCongress woman Ilhan Omar-\nSpeaker 2: (50:21)\nNo.\nDonald Trump: (50:21)\nI mean I hear the boo’s. How the hell did she win the primary? How did she win the… [Lacey 00:50:26], what the hell happened Lacey?\nSpeaker 3: (50:28)\n[inaudible 00:50:28]-\nDonald Trump: (50:29)\nHuh? It’s Jason’s fault. How the hell did she win? This woman is crazy. She’s a horrible woman who hates our country. Yeah, mail in vote, you might be right. We’ll have to check it. Let’s check the mail in vote. No, seriously how does a woman who hates our country, who says nothing but bad things about our country and Israel and other of our allies, how does this woman win? Where are the people that would vote for her? Omar called the Minneapolis police the cancer and said they were rotten to the root, but Joe Biden did not condemn the comments. He didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t disavow her endorsement. He displays it proudly on his website. This is what’s going to be running the country.\nDonald Trump: (51:18)\nThis is the biggest change between what happened between now and Crooked Hillary. Crooked Hillary was bad news, right? Remember she said, “Will you accept the results of the election? Will you accept the results of this election?” And I sort of said, “Yeah, maybe.” But she didn’t accept them, right? I remember that question. That was probably the toughest question I had out of all of them. But she hasn’t been exactly a gracious loser. She’s a loser, but not a gracious one.\nDonald Trump: (51:54)\nIf Joe Biden and the radical Dems take power, they will pass legislation gutting every single police department in America. That’s going to happen. The Biden Bernie manifesto calls for appointing far left prosecutors, judges, and justices of the United States Supreme Court.\nDonald Trump: (52:21)\nLook, we have a big thing with the court. The next president has a chance to do three, four, could even be five. You will change this country around. It will be irreversible. It will be irreversible and they’ll coddle criminals and punish law abiding citizens, these judges will. They’ll take away your guns while letting criminal gangs like MS-13 roam free. Your Second Amendment will… look it was under siege, but not really, because they had never… right fellows? They played the game with… they had no chance. When I’m here, they have no chance. Your Second Amendment is cherished. You need your Second Amendment. They will either take it away, or obliterate it into meaningless nothing.\nDonald Trump: (53:11)\nIn Joe Biden’s America, the protections of American citizenship will be stripped away and your community will be left at the mercy of the mob. I mean I’m saying these things, but I mean them. When I look at what happened in Minneapolis, when you look at what’s going on in different cities that are just unbelievable cities. Remember this though, most of the country is very safe. In fact, crime stats, outside of Chicago, New York, a couple of the crime stats are a record low. Our country’s… even during the pandemic we’re doing well, but where they’re run by the Liberal Democrats, we’re not doing well. And we have to get in. They have to ask us. We had to be asked here. They have to ask us unless we take a very severe action which ideally you don’t want to take. But every time we go in, we solve the problem and we solve it very quickly.\nDonald Trump: (54:08)\nSeattle, look at what’s going on with Seattle. I mean this is a city. This is a real city and they took over a large portion of that city and they knew we were going in the following day. They knew it. So they sent their police in and it was like nobody ever gave up so easily as those characters. But they’re radical left anarchists. Whether you’re registered as a Democrat, Independent, or Republican, I’m asking for the vote of every American who believes that police officers are not enemies, but heroes who keep us safe.\nDonald Trump: (54:42)\nI also want to send our special thanks to the members of the Minnesota National Guard who did such an incredible job stopping the rioting, violence, mayhem in Minneapolis. They were great. They were great. I love them. I love that. It’s just a beautiful thing. It’s the way it’s supposed to work. They cause problems, you have to do it. And the sooner you do it the easier it is to do.\nDonald Trump: (55:15)\nMy administration had made clear to every mayor and governor in the country that the federal government is ready to send the National Guard and federal reinforcements. We will wipe out the problem within minutes. You saw it happening right here. You wouldn’t have a city if we didn’t demand that that take place. You wouldn’t have a city.\nDonald Trump: (55:38)\nAll you have to do is say the word. Every voter should ask themselves a simple question, do you want the radical left policies of Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco imposed on the entire country? Look at Nancy Pelosi. San Francisco’s going to hell and she’s in Congress saying what we should be doing. Look at the homeless problem in San Francisco. Look at what’s happening in San Francisco and then she’s telling us about the post office. She has no clue and I must tell you this, does she love our country? Does she love our country? I don’t think so, to be honest with you. What she’s done is a disgrace to our country. What she’s done, and Schumer Crying Chuck. Crying Chuck. He cries whenever its important to cry. You want the failed policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio? Or Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago?\nSpeaker 2: (56:32)\nNo.\nDonald Trump: (56:33)\nOr mayor Jacob Frey?\nSpeaker 2: (56:35)\nNo.\nDonald Trump: (56:37)\nBrought to every city and town in this nation? If left wing Democrats can’t run a city, why on earth would you let them run your country? We have such incredibly run cities. Such incredibly run cities. The problems with have are the radical left and now she wants one trillion dollars and she’s holding it up using a phony excuse of the post office because she wants a trillion dollars to go… and you guys all know this, she wants one trillion dollars to go to these badly run democrat cities and states. That’s what she wants and she’s using the post office. We want to fix the post office and make it better. Should have been fixed 30 years ago.\nDonald Trump: (57:19)\nOver the next four years, we’re going to implement an aggressive strategy to fight violent crime. It’s already been implemented and we’ll expand the surge of federal law enforcement into crime plagued cities and we can do that at will. We just have to hear from your governor. Just call up, let us know, we’ll be there. We are ready, willing, and able.\nDonald Trump: (57:42)\n… American child is safe on our streets. In which every American family is secure in their homes, and in which all of the American people are confident in our destiny. But to achieve this vision, we must finish the job and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And get Jason in there please, Jason Lewis, get him in. Jason, you got to win. Get Jason Lewis. Jason Lewis. Got to win Jason. You’re certainly against a weak opponent. You got to win.\nDonald Trump: (58:20)\nFor years left wing politicians like Joe Biden talked about supporting American workers. Then they got elected and gave away your jobs, shipped away your factories, and they sold off your dreams, your beautiful, beautiful American dreams. They sold them off to the highest bidder. But under this administration, those days are over. Now you have a president who is fighting for you.\nDonald Trump: (58:49)\nOver the next four years, we will fully restore America’s manufacturing independence. We will again rebuild the greatest economy in history. It’s happening very fast. You’re going to see it very soon. I’d lift it to even more incredible heights than what we had last year. You had the greatest year in the history of your state last year. We will revitalize police departments and reclaim our cities for law abiding Americans. We will protect religious liberty, defend the lives of our beautiful unborn children, appoint conservative judges, uphold free speech on college campuses, and safeguard the Second Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms.\nDonald Trump: (59:40)\nWe will ensure American dominance in space and in military and pave the way to becoming the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. We’re working on that, we’re doing very well. By the way when I took over NASA, it was dead. It was gone, right? It was gone. There was nothing. There was grass growing on the runways… grass, through the crevices on the runway. It was terrible and now it’s the most vital space program anywhere in the world. Not only the jobs, but the importance of it and the psychology of it, and by the way, for military defense. And we created Space Force. Think of that, we created another one of many, many things. First time in 78 years. Last one was the Air Force, right? Space Force, that’s a big deal. By itself. If a president did that, they would have achieved something. We did that and we did hundreds of other things.\nDonald Trump: (01:00:34)\nWe will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to respect our great American flag. We will never waiver in defense of our families, our values, our faith, our jobs, our borders, our rights, or our freedoms. Together we will unite citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed as one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.\nDonald Trump: (01:01:07)\nI want to thank you, you are incredible people, Minnesota. Thank you very much. I’ll be back. November 3rd, we have to win. God bless you, God bless the great state of Minnesota and God bless America. Thank you all very much.', 'President Donald Trump: (00:00)\nThank you very much. What a nice group of people. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to treat you right. They’re not. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to change that around quickly.\nPresident Donald Trump: (00:19)\nPat, I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time. I’ve known you for a long time. You do one hell of a job, and you’re pretty popular with these people I see. [crosstalk 00:00:28]. Thank you, Pat. Well, maybe I’ll say a few words. It’s appropriate in light of everything that’s going on. When you look at all of the statistics, all of the numbers, New York’s finest, I love, and you’re the finest, they just don’t let you do the job [crosstalk 00:00:44]. They won’t let you do your job, that’s all it is.\nPresident Donald Trump: (00:49)\nSo it’s my great honor to proudly accept something that Pat’s going to give me in a little while, so I’ll hold off on the word endorsement, but he’s going to give me an endorsement, I understand. And I have deeply and profoundly admired the brave men and women, as you know, of New York City’s finest, and I’ve admired you my whole life. My whole life I’ve watched you do a job like nobody else. Nobody else has done it. And truly, you’re the best of the best and I’m grateful. And I’m very happy that you’re here, and we’ll have a little fun for a little while, but first we’re going to talk a little business. We have to talk business because we have to straighten out our city. Our city’s a mess.\nPresident Donald Trump: (01:33)\nEvery day, the courageous offices of NYPD put your lives on the line to protect the innocent and to put violent criminals behind bars. You protect people you’ve never met before. You know, I’ve heard that expression a long time ago, and it always means something to me. You’re protecting people with your lives, people that you’ve never met before, and you’ve done an incredible job.\nPresident Donald Trump: (01:56)\nAnd the world will never forget the New York police offices who ran into the smoke and flames of 9/11, I was there, many never to return. We salute the heroes of NYPD and we salute our law enforcement heroes all across the nation. I was responsible, along with a couple of people that were right in this audience, for getting you some very good and large payments so that we can take care of some of the people that were hurt so badly. Longterm hurt they call it, right? Longterm hurt, but we got it done and we got it signed. We got it signed and we’re taking of a lot of people.\nPresident Donald Trump: (02:37)\nAnd we want to thank our great firefighters also, right alongside of you, right? Our great firefighters.\nPresident Donald Trump: (02:44)\nAs we gather today, our country is suffering from a radical far left movement. It’s not even to be believed when you see this, what they’re thinking. Where did these people come from? Where do they come from? That is trying to defame, demoralize, defund, dismantle, and dissolve our great police departments. It’s a left wing war on cops.\nPresident Donald Trump: (03:07)\nIf Sleepy Joe Biden were to become precedent, he would immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America. You know that. And probably, she’s a step worse. She’s a step worse, Kamala. I was sort of hoping he was going to pick Pocahontas, but that [ inaudible 00:03:32]. She of Indian heritage number. Remember I said I have more Indian than her, I have more Indian than she does? And I went into it. I went into it at great length and I turned out to be right. I have none and I had more than she had. She’s another beauty.\nPresident Donald Trump: (03:51)\nPortland and Chicago are the left’s roadmap to America, and sadly, what’s happened over the last year in New York City. And it’s an incredible thing to look at, an incredible, incredible thing. And I just saw somebody here named Rudy Giuliani. Do you know Rudy Giuliani? Where’s Rudy? Is he around here? Get up here, Rudy. Get up. What are you doing down there, Mr. Mayor? This the greatest Mayor our city has ever had. Rudy, come on up here. Come on up. What a great… And he’s a man who is loyal and dedicated and tough. He got on television to defend me. He said things that even I wouldn’t say. He was brutal. He is incredible. He knew. He got it.\nPresident Donald Trump: (04:40)\nJoe Biden’s national police strategy will be modeled on the Bill DeBlasio, catastrophe. It’s a catastrophe. No one will be safe in Biden’s American, no city, no town, no suburb will be spared. And you see how I did something to help the suburbs of our country last week? A lot of people don’t want to even talk about it, but we did something that nobody else would have done. They’re ruining your suburbs. They want to ruin it. They want to destroy their housing values and your safety. But we ended it. We ended the program entirely. Somebody said, “Let’s amend it.” I said, “No, let’s end it.”\nPresident Donald Trump: (05:22)\nThe Biden-Harris agenda, and I guess Harris could be bigger than you think in terms of the importances of vice president. They said there’s never been a more important pick, but in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re going to win. [crosstalk 00:05:34]. You know, honestly, we don’t have a choice. We have to win. This country will go to hell. The stock markets will crash. Your 401ks are going to be worthless. You’ll see. You’ll see what would happen, crime all over the place.\nPresident Donald Trump: (05:48)\nI mean, you take a look at Portland. You take a look at Chicago, and I can name plenty of other cities, but I don’t want to embarrass anybody. My agenda is anti-crime and pro-cop all the way and that’s what it’s got to be.\nPresident Donald Trump: (06:03)\nSo in recent months, New York City has witnessed the horrors that result from putting extreme left politicians into power. DeBlasio has launched a crusade against, and he really has, he has launched a real crusade against the police like I don’t think anybody’s ever really seen, but there are cases that are just as bad. There are some cases, radical left, that may be even are worse.\nPresident Donald Trump: (06:31)\nThe mobs have scrawled disgusting slogans such as cops must die. Think of this, cops must die and kill all cops. Okay? Who would even have thought 10 years ago that was possible? On the side of buildings, they put those terms. And they vandalized St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, with horrible, horrible statements, horrible phrases. And then of course that disgusting chant, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” right? Remember that?\nPresident Donald Trump: (07:09)\nAnd now, all of a sudden, it becomes mainstream. It becomes, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful?” They were talking about you. You know that, right? We just can’t forget it because we have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country, and we’re doing it. Wherever we go, we do it. But when you have the radical left running it, no good.\nPresident Donald Trump: (07:30)\nRioters have rampaged through Manhattan and looted Fifth Avenue and an NYPD Sargent was left, as you know very well, in critical condition after being rundown with a car. A Molotov cocktail was thrown into a police vehicle in Brooklyn. And NYPD’s highest ranking uniform chief and other offices were beaten in broad daylight on the Brooklyn Bridge. And they’re not allowed to fight back. You’re not allowed to fight back. You fight back, you lose your pension, you lose your life. They put you in jail you fight back. No, you got to be able to fight back.\nPresident Donald Trump: (08:06)\nI mean, to me, one of the saddest, and I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but one of the saddest things, Rudy, that I’ve ever seen, Pat, was when they were dumping water on the heads of two of your fellow officers. And I wish they fought back. I promise nothing would have happened to them. Because who even knew that was water? It could have been plenty of other things. It probably was actually. But it could have been some very dangerous material, not water. And they didn’t fight back. The first time I’ve ever seen that. I wish they did. I wish they did. I wish I could have talked to them. I said, “Fight back. I swear you’ll be protected.”\nPresident Donald Trump: (08:44)\nThis is the left’s vision for the future of the United States of America. If they win this election, November 3rd, got to get out, got to get everybody you know. You know, the Democrats have an advantage because they have certain people that automatically vote. And we’re going from New York. We’re going for New York [crosstalk 00:09:02]. Because we did well last time. You know, New York is not supposed to be Republican territory. It was Ronald Reagan. But a lot of the people left. A lot of the people that voted for Ronald Reagan left. That was the last time. And they voted for Ronald Reagan, but they left. They went on to other places. They got tired of being abused and high taxes and all of the other problems.\nPresident Donald Trump: (09:26)\nAnd we’re going to go and run and we’re going to run on law and order, and we’re going to run our lower taxes, and we’re going to run on doing something with salt. You know what the salt is? Remember Schumer? Schumer said, “I try and bring home things to my people in New York.” You know what he brought home? Salt. For those of you that don’t know, look it up. It’s not good.\nPresident Donald Trump: (09:50)\nBut if they win this election, every city in America will be under siege. You know that. Because the police are good in Seattle and they’re good in all of these different places I talked about. They’re not being let do their job. Can’t do their job.\nPresident Donald Trump: (10:06)\nTheir pro-crime agenda, the Biden-Harris group will also crush our economy because there is no prosperity in cities that are ruled by fear. And I even think the politicians are afraid. If you look at Portland, the Mayor is trying to say, “Oh, these are my friends.” And then he goes in there, they want to beat the hell out of him. And then the fake news doesn’t report that. They’ll show him standing there with the sound down so you don’t hear what they’re saying to the Mayor. Fortunately, he had five body guards when he went in, right? But it was very dangerous for him. And I don’t know if he’s doing this at a stupidity or out of fear. Because I think they’re afraid actually.\nPresident Donald Trump: (10:44)\nYeah. It sounds like one my friends.\nPresident Donald Trump: (10:49)\nMy administration has made clear that the Department of Justice will partner arm-in-arm with our police heroes. And we’re with you all the way and we’ll prosecute all federal violations to the fullest extent of the law. But you know, we have to be invited in, unless we do something very drastic, which is a big statement, but we have to be invited in. But you don’t need help. You guys don’t need help. You have the greatest police force in the world. You have the greatest in the world. All they have to do is tell your top people to do your job and you’re going to do it properly. You’re not going to do something in excess to what [inaudible 00:11:26], but they want to tell you to do your job and you’re not going to have any crime in New York. It’s going to go down like it did with Rudy Giuliani. It’s going to go down so fast.\nPresident Donald Trump: (11:35)\nThat happened quickly, Rudy. That didn’t take too long.\nRudy Giuliani: (11:38)\nNot at all.\nPresident Donald Trump: (11:39)\nThat didn’t take too long. You, he looks good enough. Let’s draft Rudy. You better be careful, he’d win it. He’d win very easily. Because people want that back. They want it back. That’s why I think, I really am, I’m putting it into play. Most people would say, “Oh, spend your time in other places,” but I’m going to put it. We did very well. We did incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various, Staten Island was-\nPresident Donald Trump: (12:03)\nIncredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various … Staten Island was great, right? Staten Island was great. By the way, Joe Rose is a disaster. I will tell you that. I hope they get him out of there. He’s a total lightweight in many ways. Joe Rose, get him out.\nSpeaker 3: (12:17)\nGet him out.\nPresident Donald Trump: (12:18)\nHe turns out he’s another beauty. My administration will so increase funding for police so that we can hire more police offices nationwide. We’re increasing funding very substantially. And in many cases, they don’t want it. They want to put into a different group. I said, “What’s that group all about?” And it’s called socialism, and it doesn’t work. Never will work.\nCrowd: (12:41)\nBoo.\nPresident Donald Trump: (12:42)\nBy contrast, New York City voted to defund the police by $1 billion, if you can believe it, even after experiencing the bloodiest June in nearly 25 years. It’s dismantled an elite team of crime fighters, that crime fighting unit that your friends, there were incredible people. They were making us all safe. Nationwide, they were making us safe and we got to get them back. We got to bring them back. Hopefully, they don’t get a job for too much money. Tell them not to look too hard because we’re going to bring them back. We’ll get them back. They’re the best. [Rudy 00:13:17] started that. They’re the best. Joe Biden and Kamala, they always say Kamala, Kamala, Harris have a plan to spread this mayhem to every community in America.\nPresident Donald Trump: (13:29)\nNow, in all fairness to Joe, he doesn’t really know what’s happening. They say, “Joe, we’re going to spread it around. Oh, okay. Okay.” This guy doesn’t answer any questions. He gets up today. He made a statement. I just did an incredible deal with UAE. You saw that, right? Everyone’s shocked. Even the New York Times said it was incredible deal. Can you believe? The New York Times? I can’t even believe it. Thomas Friedman, they wrote an incredible editorial. It was a great deal. So we did this deal. Nobody else did it. In fact, we were at a huge deficit because of the horrible deal that Obama made with Iran. Gave them $150 billion, billion, not million. 150 million’s a lot. That would be too much also. 150 billion then gave them 1.8 billion in cash. I broke the deal. I terminated the deal, but we made a deal, UAE and Israel. And sleepy Joe got up and said he made the deal. I said, “Whoa.” Did anybody hear that? He actually took credit for making that deal.\nSpeaker 4: (14:31)\nDebate him.\nPresident Donald Trump: (14:33)\nFor a change, I’m being praised all over the world for making that deal, and that’s just the beginning. I think they just said, “Say this Joe. Say that you made it.” It’s like it was Obama’s economy right? Before the plague, we had the greatest economy in history. Greatest economy anywhere in the world, let alone ours. And now we’re building it back up very rapidly. You see the numbers. But they were taking credit. They said, “Oh, this was Obama. Obama.” He said manufacturing would never come back. That was Obama. Manufacturing has come back big. In fact, even two days ago, they announced incredible numbers. When asked recently if he favors cutting police budget, Biden replied. “Yes, absolutely.” But I’m not sure honestly he knew what he was replying to so we’re not … “Yes, absolutely. What did I say? What was I referring to?” You could use that clip for a million different things right? Yes, absolutely. You never say that as a politician. You always finish out.\nPresident Donald Trump: (15:26)\nBiden has been described by police as and he described the police, you saw that, as the enemy. He said it’s the enemy. Kamala Harris applauded LA’s recent decision to slash its police budget, and LA really went to town on it, you saw that. Millions and millions of dollars off their budget. After the riots in Minneapolis, Kamala encouraged Americans to donate money to the so-called Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out rapists, assaulters and murderers. They bailed them right out of jail. Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. We can’t lose this election. Okay?\nCrowd: (16:05)\n[crosstalk 00:04:06].\nPresident Donald Trump: (16:05)\nWe can’t loose.\nSpeaker 5: (16:06)\nNot going to happen.\nPresident Donald Trump: (16:08)\nWe’re building a big wall. We’re building the wall. It’s up to almost … Look at her. She’s all excited about that. That’s-\nSpeaker 5: (16:15)\nBuild the wall, build the wall-\nCrowd: (16:15)\nBuild the wall, build the wall, build the wall, build the wall-\nPresident Donald Trump: (16:15)\nYeah, we’re building. It’s up to 280 miles. Will be up … That’ll be completed-\nSpeaker 6: (16:27)\n[inaudible 00:00:16:27].\nPresident Donald Trump: (16:27)\nYou’re right. I like her. No, you’re right. And you know who like the wall? The Southern border, you know who like at the most? Hispanics, because they know the area. They know what comes in and they want to be safe. They want to keep their good jobs. They want to keep their beautiful houses. They’ve done well, but they know the area the best. We’re doing great with the Hispanics. As San Francisco district attorney, she chose not to seek the death penalty against a gang member who killed a San Francisco police officer going against the wishes of the officer’s wife, going against the wishes of the police. In his unity manifesto written with socialist … Bernie Sanders is another beauty, Bernie. Crazy Bernie. We’ve got names for all of them no? What’s better? Sleepy Joe or slow Joe? Tell me.\nCrowd: (17:19)\n[crosstalk 00:05:19].\nPresident Donald Trump: (17:19)\nWhat is better?\nCrowd: (17:21)\n[crosstalk 00:05:22].\nPresident Donald Trump: (17:23)\nI go back and forth.\nCrowd: (17:25)\n[crosstalk 00:05:24].\nPresident Donald Trump: (17:26)\nI go back and-\nCrowd: (17:27)\n[crosstalk 00:17:27].\nPresident Donald Trump: (17:28)\nOkay, let’s do it. Who likes Slow Joe?\nCrowd: (17:33)\nYay.\nPresident Donald Trump: (17:33)\nWho likes Sleepy Joe?\nCrowd: (17:37)\nYeah.\nPresident Donald Trump: (17:37)\nThat’s what I thought. I got all these guys telling me, “Oh, you ought to do. We don’t like sleepy because it’s rude.” They said it’s rude. I said, “We’re talking about the president of the United States.” I can tell you one thing. Putin and Kim Jong Un and President Xi of China, they’re not sleepy. We’re never going to say sleepy or slow, and we can’t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them either because we were doing very well against all of them. All of them. And we’re have a good relationship now. Remember North Korea? We were going to go to war with North Korea. Obama would have been in a war. Millions of people could have been killed in that war. Where’s the war? Everybody said, “Trump will be in war in the first week.” Where’s the war? In fact, we’re bringing people out of the endless Wars. The Wars that where their doing your job. They’re policemen and that’s great, but they want to fight. They want to win. We didn’t let people win. Bring them back. We shouldn’t have been there in the first place. So we bring them back, and what we’re doing is bringing them back with great dignity.\nPresident Donald Trump: (18:41)\nIt’s incredible what’s happened. We’ve totally rebuilt our armed forces, $2.5 trillion. We’ve given you hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Pat, you know that. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment came out of … It was collecting dust, right? It was army surplus stuff and all the different … It was beautiful stuff and Obama didn’t want you to have it. They said it made you look too strong, too tough. You look too military. So they said, “Let them get shot.” Much of it was protective equipment. You know that. I released it all. I gave it to all the police departments all across the country and I have had more thank yous for that. And someday, they’re going to have to explain why they didn’t want to do it. And this was sitting there. It was not going to be used. A lot of it was new, but it wasn’t going to be used. And I said, “Give it to our great police all over the country.” And we did and it’s been great.\nPresident Donald Trump: (19:34)\nAnd just to finish up, I call it the manifesto because Bernie Sanders, he was going to make an agreement and they were going to go a little bit further right. They didn’t. They went further left than Bernie was. So in the manifesto, Biden pledges to abolish cash bail. How about that? No cash bail. No bail, meaning that violent and dangerous criminals would simply be released after arrest. New York tried this insane policy and crime surged nearly 25% in New York City and now it’s up much, much higher than that. This is an old statistic. It’s up much higher than that. So nationwide, the Biden plan to abolish bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets.\nPresident Donald Trump: (20:23)\nSo all I’m saying is this. We have the greatest police departments. We have great police. We have great forces. They have to be allowed to do their job. And I’ve seen Pat and I’ve seen you. You’re going to have a bad apple. You’re going to have somebody who makes a horrible mistake. You’re going to have somebody has a bad moment, but it may be just a bad apple. We’ve seen it. But that doesn’t mean we’re going to close up our police departments. And like in Minneapolis, tell them to run. Leave, leave. Did you ever see anything like that? Where they left? Where they left? We can’t ever let that happen. We sent in the National Guard five or six days later. We waited, we waited, we waited. Within one hour, the whole thing was … You never heard of anything. On these monuments and statues, you saw that? They were trying to rip them down. They ripped some down. I immediately signed an order that if you get caught ripping down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in jail. 10 years.\nPresident Donald Trump: (21:26)\nAnd I don’t know about you, I haven’t seen too many statues being ripped down lately. They were going to have a march on Washington, Washington. They wanted to rip down statues. I said, “So wait a minute. You’re going to rip down statues, you’re going to go to jail for 10 years.” I signed it publicly. Very public. You got to let them know or otherwise, it’s not fair. They get 10 years, they didn’t know about it right? Wise guys. So we let them know you get 10 years in jail. I took an old law because they don’t do those laws today. Today, get that through the house. Tell Nancy Pelosi we’re going to give somebody 10 years. She’s terrible. Look at what’s happened to San Francisco. Look at the tents. Look at the homeless. That’s Nancy. She ought to go home and clean up her own city, but take a look.\nPresident Donald Trump: (22:14)\nBut it’s 10 years in jail. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They were going to come down and knock down. They had them earmarked. And as soon as they announced that, nobody showed up. It was amazing. Big march, nobody showed up. They said, “No, we’re going to do it the following …” That was a Thursday night. “We’re going to do it the next night, Friday.” Nobody showed up except four people. They all got arrested because they were the four people that the media had on top of the statue of Andrew Jackson doing damage. Almost got it down. And I’ll say something. The Washington, the D.C. police were great because they had the ropes. You saw the ropes. They were ready to pull it down. They were all set and our guys said, “Stop it.” And those guys ran in and that thing was over. Those Washington, those D.C. police did a job. That wasn’t like you know. They did a job. So we’re going to give you back your stature. We’re going to give you back your status. I hate to say it, but it’s been taken away. We’re going to give you back the right to be New York’s finest, the finest of all time, the greatest of all time, and we’re going to win on November 3rd. And the people that didn’t love Trump, never Trumpers, a lot of them are saying, “I’m starting to like Trump a lot,” because they see what’s happening. And we’re going to give New York a real shot and I think we have one hell of a shot at doing it. I just said this morning, the New York Post, which has been great. The New York post had a cover story about that. They came and interviewed me at the Oval Office and they talked about law and order in the city. And I said, “I did very well, Republican wise. I did very well.” We did great, and I really believe that that solid core of people has to be real. First of all, they’re leaving. A lot of them are leaving, but they have to be discuss-\nPresident Donald Trump: (24:03)\nI mean first of all they are leaving a lot of them are leaving, but they have to be disgusted with what’s going on. So I said then and there and I said it today. I put it out today strongly, we’re going to go and give New York a real shot. I think we have a real chance of winning New York, but we’re going to give you so much of what you’re looking for. Because I know exactly it’s so easy you need leadership, you need money, you can’t defund. It has to go the other way. You need equipment.\nPresident Donald Trump: (24:28)\nBut what do you need more than anything else is your dignity and respect. You need respect, you need your dignity back and this guy has taken your dignity away and your respect away. And I am telling you on November 3rd you’re going to be getting it back like you haven’t gotten it back before. Because this is really a referendum. So I want to thank you very much. And Pat, thank you very much. Fellas thank you.\nSpeaker 7: (24:59)\nUSA, USA, USA. Mr. President, today it’s an honor for me to stand at this podium and be the voice for 24,000 New York city police officers, proud police officers that are here today chanting USA, chanting Trump for president and they mean it each and every time they say it. Mr. President, it’s obvious where you hold the NYPD in your heart. We heard the news this morning that you got some family news that your brother had fallen ill. And naturally we thought well, we may have to postpone this. The president may not be able to come. And then our phones rang and we were told that the president will visit his brother and then he will visit with you. That’s where he puts you. New York city police officers and family. That’s the type of president we have.\nSpeaker 7: (26:16)\nMr. President what we all have in common here today is that we all have a police officers shield in our hip pocket. We all have friends and family that are here to support you. And more importantly, in this crowd is our family members too. The ones that worry what happens when their loved one takes that last step off the stoop and goes to work and they know they may not come back. And we know you understand that Mr. President, because you’re constantly always loud about the support for New York city police officers. Mr. President, this city you helped build, the borough where your father started in South Jamaica is sliding back. The borough in which you build so many skyscrapers was just recently looted. Our city is sliding back because the mantra, the false narrative that not only city hall, the second floor in the state house and those that want to become president are passing this false narrative that New York city police officers and law enforcement are evil.\nSpeaker 7: (27:34)\nHow absurd is that? That they blame us for society’s ills? Well, let me tell you this Mr. President I know you know that. The most compassionate people on the face of the earth are New York city police officers. Mr. President, if you look at the crime numbers in New York city we’re sliding back where we’re at shootings. We’re at shooting levels back to 1993. That’s because of that narrative against the police officers, that’s where they’re handcuffing our members. That’s where they’re saying if you take a bad guy off the street that you will go to jail. Now that’s the upside down world. So what we can’t do is let that attitude spread beyond the city, beyond the state house and go to the white house Mr. President.\nSpeaker 7: (28:35)\nSo we here today for a reason, a reason that you understand to support not only New York city police officers, but law enforcement across this country. And this is not new for you Mr. President, you do it always. See, the sign of a leader is someone that will stand at a podium like this and speak the truth and will say what needs to be said and not be afraid to do it.\nSpeaker 7: (29:09)\nWell, we are seeing leaders in our state that are following the crowd Mr. Mayor. Mr. President what they’re doing is not only following marches, they’re following riders. They’re trying to catch up and do whatever they can to make sure they’re happy. I often times wake up and say who were they listening to? They’re not listening to the folks in the neighborhoods that we patrol. They’re not listening to the folks that say we want police on our streets and we want to respect them. So today Mr. President, there’s two things that we’d like to do. We’d like to present you with a statue that means so much to New York city officers. This statue, we do not hand out lightly. This statue is very special to New York city police officers for what it represents. This is a police officer standing tall and proud with his hand on the shoulder of a child. Now that child represents not only a little boy, not only a little girl, but a crime victim, someone that needs our help, someone that was victimized. That’s what police officers do every day in this country and this city and this state. They stop, they put their hands, they give their comforting words, the compassionate words that helps everyone. Mr. President we know that you hold police offices in high esteem. So there’s not many of these that are given out, but we’re giving it to you today Mr. President. We hope that you can put this in a prominent spot and that people that can see it and realize that those that are in the mob that are tearing down what we do, our profession has a supporter in the oval office that understands what this stands for. Mr. President it’s my honor.\nPresident Donald Trump: (31:40)\nHow does the oval office for that sound? Okay? Good?\nSpeaker 7: (31:47)\nMr. President, I said we have two things to present to you and we presented a special statue. But we also have some practical work to do because there’s election that we’re in the midst of. So I’m here to say this number one, I have 36 years on this job, 21 as the president of this fine organization. I cannot remember when we’ve ever endorsed for the office of president of the United States until now. That’s how important this is. Mr. President we’re fighting for our lives out there. We don’t want this to spread to the rest of the country. We need your strong voice across the country to say we have the support of law enforcement across this country. Now, many times people say that a union like ours, law enforcement groups give endorsements, not in the New York city PBA sir. In the New York city PBA Mr. President you earn the endorsement and you’ve earned this endorsement. I’m proud to give it.\nPresident Donald Trump: (33:34)\nWell, I just want to thank you that was incredible. I assumed it was given out because I see a lot of things given out and they shouldn’t be given out. But a special man, you are just really special people. You really are. You’re very brave people. I will say this, you read a lot of negatives. They have a lot of fake media, fake news, false news, call it whatever you want, corrupt news. But you have no idea how much the people of this country love our police departments, our police, our law enforcement, our border patrols, our ICE people. ICE they go into the toughest situations. They take out MS13 by the thousands and then they get abused. But they’re not really abused, they’re loved by the people of this country. And New York’s great police force is something that I grew up with.\nPresident Donald Trump: (34:28)\nI used to go with my father in Brooklyn to a little, I shouldn’t tell you this, a little hamburger place for lunch. And we’d see these big cops come in and they were great. And everybody stood at attention when they walked in and we’re going to get that back. You’re respected just the same, but they don’t allow it to happen. We’re going to allow it to happen. You are great, great people. And remember this, you are loved by our country, loved by our country and respected by our country.\nPresident Donald Trump: (34:57)\nAnd all we have to do is let you do your job, right? Just let you do your job. Pat, I think it might be appropriate. So we really do. We have New York city’s greatest mayor of all time. He took over a city that I don’t know, was worse. Maybe better. I don’t know what I’m going to ask Rudy what’s the difference between that city and the city of today? Certainly it caught up very quickly for a long while it was a lot better, but when Rudy ran it, it was incredible. The crime statistics, the murder. I hate to use that word, murder. I don’t know if this place has ever heard that word murder. It’s not into the word of murder.\nPresident Donald Trump: (35:34)\nBut when you look at the stats, I looked at them the other day it was incredible what he was able to do in a short period of time with only New York’s finest. Without New York’s finest he couldn’t have done it. He let them do the job and he had three very great commissioners. He keeps telling me three great commissioners. I always say, “Who is the best?” He doesn’t want to tell me maybe he’ll tell you. But I’ve asked him many times, “Who is the best Rudy I want to know who? Who is the best?” He’ll never tell me, but there’s always the best, right? There’s always somebody. But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words.\nPresident Donald Trump: (36:03)\nBut I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words and we love you all. Thank you very much.\nRudy Giuliani: (36:06)\nThank you very much, Mr. President. It’s a beautiful thing to see.\nCrowd: (36:15)\nRudy.\nRudy Giuliani: (36:18)\nThank you.\nCrowd: (36:18)\n[inaudible 00:36:21].\nRudy Giuliani: (36:22)\nI know you since I was a little boy. My Uncle Willie, my Uncle, Bob, my Uncle Vincent, my Uncle Anthony were all New York City Police Officers. One was a Detective. One was a Sergeant. Then I had a fifth uncle, who was a firefighter, but I’m not going to mention that right now. I grew up with you and then I got to work with you as a prosecutor, and I get credit for bringing down crime more than any other mayor ever. Anywhere, but you did it. I didn’t do it. I know you did it. That’s why every time you were hurt, every time you were injured, I’d be the first one to show up at the hospital. Not because I’m a great guy, because it’s my duty to be there, because you got it done.\nRudy Giuliani: (37:08)\nI hear people say, “Oh, we don’t need police officers to reduce crime.” Out of their f’ing mind’s out of their minds. Out of their minds. I went and acquired more police. We took over the Housing Police. We took over the Transit Police. We made them all one, because I needed to reassign them to the right places. We took police officers out of white neighborhoods that voted for me, who were really angry at me for doing it, and we put it into black neighborhoods where Al Sharpton would complain about us. But the people loved it and would ask me for more. People in Harlem asked me for more. Bedford-Stuyvesant and Fort Greene, all the places you know so well. You go to the people and the President is right and Pat is right. They want you. They respect you.\nRudy Giuliani: (37:55)\nI have people of all races, black, white, Hispanic, come up to me now in the streets, and tell me, “Please, please tell someone we need more police. We love the police. Let them know it. Don’t don’t listen to these people on television. We love them.” Particularly, come from the black community, particularly. They know who you are. It’s just a bunch of, they’ve become really radicals who want to overthrow our way of life. That’s what they’re about. You’re a part of it. You’re in the way. You’re in the way of that. Being able to create a socialist government, to create a government where, well it’s going to be created because they get people to hate America. That’s why they burn statues. That’s why they burned flags. That’s why they kneel during the national anthem.\nCrowd: (38:39)\nWe don’t kneel.\nRudy Giuliani: (38:43)\nOf course, we don’t kneel. What do we do during the national anthem? We stand up, right? What do we do? That’s what we teach our children.\nCrowd: (38:55)\n[inaudible 00:00:38:56].\nRudy Giuliani: (38:55)\nIt’s all being done for a purpose though. It’s being done for a purpose. They want us to believe that our country was founded by an evil man, that our first president was an evil man. That the author of our liberty was an evil man, that the emancipator was an evil man, that the general who won the Civil War was an evil man, because they want to convince enough people, we’re a hateful country. They teach that in our schools now. 1000 schools have a curriculum, which says that America has never been able to overcome the horrible sin of slavery and that all Americans are responsible for it. Can you believe that? We’re teaching that to our children. They’re being forced-fed that in school, and then they get it from the media. It has to be you, the best representatives of the constitution, the law, fairness, decency, protection of people, have always been police offices because you do something that all the people who criticize you don’t do. You put your lives on the line every day to protect me and my family. I don’t do that and that’s why I honor you.\nRudy Giuliani: (40:06)\nYou made the right choice in this president. I was with him when he ran in 2016. I was with him for four straight months. He would campaign until 11 o’clock, 12 o’clock, one o’clock, two o’clock, three o’clock, four o’clock. All the kids would be asleep on the plane. He would be awake. No matter how late it was, when we’d get to the airport, everybody was exhausted. There’d a be about 30 cops that were there. Maybe the guys on the motorcycles, or couple of guys guarding the plane. Everybody wanted to rush on the plane and every other candidate I ever saw rushed on the plane. He never once rushed on the plane. No matter how far he had a walk, he went up to the uniform and he shook hands with every single one of them. He did it because it’s for real. He’s not a politician. He’s actually a real person. That’s why, he’s accomplished in three and a half years, more than any other president, I interviewed an African-American gentleman the other day. I have a tape. He said that this is the best president for the African-American community since Abraham Lincoln, nobody even close.\nCrowd: (41:28)\nFour more years. Four more years.\nRudy Giuliani: (41:30)\nHe’s the best president for police officers.\nCrowd: (41:32)\nFour more years. Four more years.Four more years. Four more years.\nRudy Giuliani: (41:37)\nHe just accomplished what nobody else was able to accomplish in the Middle East. Nobody has been able to bring a Gulf Arab state to say they’re going to recognize the state of Israel. No one has done that. Obama made it almost impossible to do it because he had an animosity toward Israel that was sick. He’s turned that all around. He’s turned around the reputation of our country in the world. He made it the greatest economy we’ve ever had. We got a terrible setback because of China, that owns Joe Biden. I have, I can prove that to you, but that’s another story. They own him. They own his son. They won his family. He doesn’t even have the room to negotiate with China. You’re cops. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you?\nCrowd: (42:25)\n[inaudible 00:06:26].\nRudy Giuliani: (42:26)\nYeah.\nCrowd: (42:28)\n[inaudible 00:06:28].\nRudy Giuliani: (42:28)\nAll that money for the kid, was for the kid. China’s going to give away $1.5 billion to that kid who can’t hold a job? I’m not going to say why. Some of you are probably detectives. You figure out, why did they give $1.5 billion to the Biden family when Joe Biden was negotiating for us, US? Oh, by the way, he lost in every negotiation, but the family made 1.5 billion. I don’t got to say anymore. You got it. I feel sorry for Joe. I feel sorry that he has the senility. I feel sorry for the country that he picked that horrible prosecutor. That woman is a bully. She’s a bully. Here’s what I mean by that. I know prosecutors like you know cops. She prosecuted little people and she wouldn’t prosecute big people.\nRudy Giuliani: (43:22)\nAll the politicians in San Francisco, all Willie Brown’s friends, they went free, but she went after 1500 marijuana smokers. Marijuana smokers, not people selling it, smokers. Then when she was asked if she smoked marijuana, she said, “ha, ha, ha, yeah.” Tell me this isn’t a horrible person. You put people in jail for something that you laugh about, but you put them in prison and take their liberty away because she wanted statistics, because she’s a bully. She can’t be that close to the … Oh my God. Thank you. I know what you guys can do and women. I know what you can do on the streets to protect us. I know what you can do politically too. Let’s get them elected. We need him right now more than he needs us. Thank you.\nPresident Donald Trump: (44:11)\nThank you. Does anyone else want to speak. Does anyone else want to … So again, it’s an honor that you came. I just want to pay my respects to a really good guy that I love. It’s my brother, he’s very ill and he would not have … I mean, he just said, “Don’t even think about it.” I really appreciate what he said. He’s having a very tough time, but I really appreciate being with you today. He respected you as much as I do. He respected you, like everybody. We all respect you and we’re going to let you do your job. We’re going to let you do your job. That’s all we have to do. Again, thank you very much. It’s such an honor to be with you, to get the endorsement pad of this group of incredible men and women is mind-blowing. Really it is.\nSpeaker 8: (45:15)\nThank you, very much.\nPresident Donald Trump: (45:15)\nMind blowing and just, I’m going to leave you with this very simple phrase. I will never, ever let you down. I will never let you down. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.', 'Vice President Mike Pence: (00:00)\n… here in this barn in the Hawkeye State to look out and see this inspiring gathering. Small but mighty. Men and women wearing the uniform of law enforcement. Let me say to each and every one of you on behalf of the President of the United States, on behalf of your Vice President and on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you for your courageous service every day. We will always back the blue. It is a momentous time in the life of our nation, gone through and are going through a time of testing but soon we’ll come to a time [inaudible 00:00:41] and public safety is very much on the minds of the American people as Senator Ernst just reflected and as you heard from the Secretary of Homeland Security earlier in this very same program. You have a president, you have an administration that are committed to law and order and to supporting men and women who serve on the thin blue line.\nVice President Mike Pence: (01:11)\nBut I also want to say, I know that here across the heartland of America, you’ve just endured some unprecedented storms and I know that the police officers and sheriffs who are standing before me today, and many that are looking on from afar have played a role in responding to families in the midst of this devastation. We grieve for the loss of three lives in two states. But I met with families today that have literally lost millions of dollars of crops as well and property.\nVice President Mike Pence: (01:43)\nBut on behalf of all of the families that you responded to and once again that you went into harm’s way where others might have been running in another direction. Let me thank you for what you have done in these unprecedented storms for the people of Iowa and the people of America. Well done. And again, I just want to say thank you to Heritage Action. I know we’re going to be having a conversation in a few moments, but Jessica and Heritage Action are a bulwark of freedom and free markets, but I’m particularly grateful that Heritage Action would use their vast reach across this country to focus on that, which I believe is of first importance for the American people.\nVice President Mike Pence: (02:32)\nSecurity is the foundation of our prosperity. Our nation is able to be free and prosperous because people wear the uniform of the United States and serve at home and abroad defending this nation. But we’re able to live in the most prosperous nation on Earth and to run our businesses, to raise our families because of the thin blue line. Because each one of you ever done straps on a sidearm, puts on a badge, puts on the uniform and you count your lives as less important than ours.\nVice President Mike Pence: (03:09)\nI mean, it’s a humbling thing to think about. I love what the Bible says about those who bear the sword. You do not bear the sword in vain, throughout history, the good book says servants for good. And I want to tell you that as we were running for this office four years ago here in the great state of Iowa, and as we’ve served in this office every day since, it’s been a challenging time for law enforcement.\nVice President Mike Pence: (03:34)\nIn the last administration, it seemed like a reflexive effort to blame police first and we’re hearing the most contemptible slander against law enforcement and even up to this present day. But I want to assure you that your president and this vice president know that the men and women who serve in law enforcement, you’re the best people in this country and you will always have the support of the American people.\nVice President Mike Pence: (04:10)\nBut this is a challenging time. It truly is and I’m grateful not only for Senator Joni Ernst, but let me also say I’m truly grateful for the service and the leadership in a challenging time by the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Chad has done a remarkable job for the American people and join me in thanking acting secretary, Chad Wolf for all he does for America every day. I also want to thank, I want to thank Governor Kim Reynolds, who will be along directly. The support that she’s lent to law enforcement here in Iowa.\nVice President Mike Pence: (04:53)\nShe’s really set an extraordinary standard and we’re truly grateful. Join me in thanking Governor Kim Reynolds for her great leadership during a challenging time for the people of Iowa. We live in a time when we literally have leading politicians that are talking about defunding the police. And as that rhetoric rises from even some of the leading democrat politicians in America. We’re actually seeing a rise in violence across the country in cities where the case for defunding is being made most poignantly.\nVice President Mike Pence: (05:32)\nAnd it’s remarkable to think as liberal politicians are talking about dismantling the police department as they suggested in Minneapolis, cutting NYPD by a billion dollars in New York, in one city after another Seattle, Portland and elsewhere. We also see a rise in crime. I pulled these statistics on the way here on Air Force Two. Atlanta saw 19% rise in shootings and a 9% rise in murders just in the recent days. Chicago’s seen a 42% rise in shootings. Philadelphia has seen a 54% rise in shootings and a 20% rise in murders. New York City actually just reached its 1000th victim with more shootings this year already than in the last two years combined. And 21 people were shot in our nation’s capital last weekend.\nVice President Mike Pence: (06:32)\nThese are heartbreaking numbers, but I must tell all of you that they’re just a preview of Joe Biden’s agenda for America. The truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America. When he was asked recently about law enforcement, he actually described well-armed police officers as people that could become “the enemy” to civilians. When he was asked if he would support redirecting funding for law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, ‘Yes, absolutely.”\nVice President Mike Pence: (07:12)\nIn fact, his new running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris absolutely said when she was a candidate for president that it was time to in her words, “Reimagine police.” I mean, the truth is these efforts of blaming law enforcement for violence in our streets, blaming law enforcement for unrest across America have got to end. We must back the blue and we must support law enforcement for the safety of all of our families of every race and creed and color.\nVice President Mike Pence: (07:59)\nThere’s a false choice out there the liberal politicians are projecting. It suggests that we’ve got to choose between supporting law enforcement or supporting our African American community. The truth of the matter is we have done both. We will continue to do both. And with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, we’re going to support law enforcement and expanded public safety and opportunity for African Americans and every American of every race.\nVice President Mike Pence: (08:36)\nWe can do both. And that’s why under this administration, we’ve supported funding through the COPS program to hire 4,000 new police officers on the streets of America. It’s also why this president in the wake of senseless violence that continues at this very hour in Portland, Oregon and in cities around the country, the president launched what we call Operation LeGend. It’s actually named after a four-year-old little boy.\nVice President Mike Pence: (09:02)\nIt’s actually named a four-year-old little boy, LeGend Taliferro. LeGend was in his home, building a pillow fort with his dad. He was asleep that night in the pillow fort when gunfire broke out. Police officers arrived on the scene, they rushed little LeGend to the hospital but we lost him, but let me promise you. That little boy, little LeGend will not have died in vain. Operation Legend is going to save lives of children and families all across America. We will.\nVice President Mike Pence: (09:51)\nWe’re surging personnel, surging resources, in cooperation with local law enforcement. We’re going to bring peace to our cities and we’re going to quell the violence and what’s the American people deserve. They deserve the support of law enforcement in their cities and that’s what you who serve in law enforcement deserve every day. So I look forward to our conversation today. It’s always humbling to stand before police officers and I never wore the uniform of law enforcement but my uncle was a cop in Chicago, Illinois for 25 years and I remember when we’d drive up from that small town in Indiana where I grew up and we’d go to Chicago to visit my grandparents, me and my three brothers would marvel as he walked out of his bedroom every day, wearing that badge, having that sidearm. We’d look up at him and we’d see a hero.\nVice President Mike Pence: (10:54)\nI just want to assure each and every one of you that whatever happens in the public debate, that’s how the American people see you. Each and every one of you, I truly believe with all my heart are heroes and never doubt the American people know it, we’ll always be grateful for the men and women of law enforcement. You’re in the prayers of tens of millions of Americans every day, and let me say to you, but just as much to your families who are gathered here today, thank you for your service. I promise you, we’ll always back the blue. Thank you and God bless you.\nJessica: (11:42)\nWell Mr. Vice President, thank you for those comments and for sitting with us today. It’s such a timely discussion as we spent the afternoon talking about this issue and the need for safety and security both in our neighborhoods, our larger cities, and it expands outside of just Iowa, it’s a nationwide issue so to kick off our discussion today, we have the real privilege of hearing from some audience members that have joined us for our town hall so I’d like to introduce our first, Mr. Devin Sanders. Devin is a local business owner and he is a 12-year combat veteran so Devin, we’ve got your first question. Devin, this is Mr. Vice President. Meet each other and let’s kick it off.\nVice President Mike Pence: (12:38)\nThank you Devin. Great to meet you Devin.\nDevin Sanders: (12:40)\nYou as well. We actually met in Council Bluffs. Appreciate meeting you.\nDevin Sanders: (12:40)\nThe most beautiful day Iowa has to offer.\nVice President Mike Pence: (12:40)\nBeautiful day, feels like I’m back in Indiana.\nDevin Sanders: (12:44)\nSo as a small business owner and I’m sure a lot of civilians all across the U.S. and every state. We’ve experienced an uprise and especially as a small business owner who makes … I make wooden flags for a living, I love spreading patriotism, but it seems like every event that I go to, I get harassed, I get told that I should be ashamed of spreading hatred and racism and just for supporting law enforcement and as cheesy as it sounds, I love supporting the flag, it’s the best thing on earth. I think it’s beautiful in everything that it stands for. So my question to you, this past few months have shown how strong the mob and cancel culture is to businesses and private citizens and standing up for their beliefs and livelihood. How has the Trump administration stood up for the safety, the constitutional freedoms of the American people?\nVice President Mike Pence: (13:35)\nWell thank you for the question but more than that thank you for your service to America. Thank you. We’re eternally grateful, and it’s good to see you again. It really is. Well look, with regard to public safety, because on the larger question, let me just … I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president who has appointed more than 200 principled conservative men and women to our federal courts at every level who I promise you will uphold all the God-given liberties in our constitution from freedom of religion, freedom of speech to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. This administration is proud of the way we’ve been able, 200 appointees to our court with the strong support of Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Joni Ernst and we’ll continue to stand strong for all of those freedoms and all of those liberties. Including the freedom of speech. The right of peaceably assembling, the right as peaceable protest is as old as the nation, but let’s be clear. Burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not peaceful protest. People who destroy businesses and destroy properties and destroy statues will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Justice will be served.\nVice President Mike Pence: (15:12)\nI will tell you that in Washington, D.C. and I don’t have to tell the police officers here. There’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis and justice will be served, but there’s also no excuse for the rioting and the looting and the destruction of property that followed and that’s why President Trump took the action that he took in Minneapolis. He said to the governor of Minnesota, he said, “Either you quell the violence in your city or we will.” To his credit, Governor Walz deployed the National Guard and brought peace to the streets of Minneapolis. Acting Secretary Wolf will tell you, we had the very same conversation, after weeks and weeks, more than 60 days of violence around the federal courthouse in Portland, our administration spoke with Governor Brown and essentially said to her our federal officials are going to be there to protect the courthouse and to keep peace in the streets around it if you don’t and just a matter of two weeks ago she issued and deployed the state police to the region and deployed Portland police.\nVice President Mike Pence: (16:22)\nThe violence has continued but the president has made it clear, whether it’s Portland, whether it’s Seattle, whether it’s Chicago, whether it’s New York City, we’re calling on mayors, we’re calling on governors to let law enforcement do your job and if they won’t let you do it, we’ll do it. We have the obligation to bring public safety and security to our streets.\nJessica: (16:48)\nThank you.\nVice President Mike Pence: (16:48)\nThank you very much.\nJessica: (16:54)\nMr. Vice President, it’s been such an interesting thing to watch the different phases of the violence and destruction over the last few months and the people that have truly been on the frontlines are our law enforcement officers and so I’d like to call up next Lieutenant [Todd Perdue 00:17:12]. He is 18 years in service here in Iowa, Crawford County sheriff’s office. Lieutenant, thank you for being with us. What is your question today sir?\nVice President Mike Pence: (17:23)\nHey Todd, great to meet you.\nTodd Perdue: (17:36)\nThank you Mr. Vice President for being with us today and coming to speak with us.\nTodd Perdue: (17:37)\nObviously with everything that’s going on in the country with law enforcement, recruiting and retention has been a big problem. So my question to you is what is the longterm threat to police officer retention from the defunding movement and how can it be combated?\nVice President Mike Pence: (17:45)\nWell thank you Lieutenant Perdue and if you just join me in thanking him for a great career of service in law enforcement. Truly grateful to you. Recruitment and retention [inaudible 00:17:57] critical. When I was governor of the state of Indiana, I will tell you some of the most meaningful experiences I had was\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:03)\n… you, some of the most meaningful experiences I had was attending graduations from our police academy in the state of Indiana. You’ve been through it. And to see these young men and women step forward and to be willing to put on the uniform of no ordinary career. That’s why I hope all of you leave here, and anybody that’s looking on, know that whatever you might hear in the public debates from the radical left, or their defenders in the Democratic party, the American people are for you. They’re grateful to you. I hear it every day. I see it in the countenance of people. Every time that I speak about law enforcement … I know President Trump sees it in the faces of Americans every time he speaks about law enforcement. I just want to be very clear, the American people love the men and women in law enforcement and we are grateful for what you do every day, really and truly.\nVice President Mike Pence: (19:00)\nNow, that being said, I think you raised a very important question. Your first obligation and the calling of your life is public safety. And so, we’re going to support law enforcement to stay on the mission of public safety. Domestic tranquility is a central feature of the purpose of government. But beyond that, the other thing that’s wrong with the language of the radical left is one can’t help but think it is both discouraging courageous young men and women from pursuing a career in law enforcement. And similarly, it’s resulting in people choosing to leave a career in law enforcement. I actually read that roughly a month ago, because of the utter lack of support for NYPD by Mayor de Blasio, that they had to set a limit, a monthly limit on the number of retirements because they couldn’t process the number of officers who were applying to retire out of NYPD early.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:13)\nI mean, that’s heartbreaking. That’s the largest police department in the United States of America. I must tell you, the world saw the character of NYPD and the New York Fire Department on September 11, 2001. These are the greatest people in the world. Many of whom lost their lives on that fateful day of 9/11. And yet, to see the Mayor talking about a billion dollar cut, pulling them back in terms of allowing them to go in and to deal with rioters and protestors, not allowing them to do their job is resulting in people losing a desire to be in law enforcement. And that’s a real cost to public safety and it’s something that we have to talk about. And I think it’s one of the reasons why I’m just so proud to serve alongside a President who backs the blue. I mean, and that’s not to say that there aren’t instances of abuse that have happened.\nVice President Mike Pence: (21:23)\nAs I said, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. But, in my experience, nobody hates bad cops more than good cops. And the over … I don’t even want to say the majority, I want to say almost everybody that wears a uniform in the United States are the best of us. And all of you gathered here, that applies to. Your point is so well taken and I hope people looking on who are part of this national debate through Heritage Action will fight for America, will carry this message even more loudly. It compromises our public safety when we don’t give support to law enforcement and let you do your job. It also compromises our public safety when young men and women or experienced law enforcement officers no longer choose to wear the uniform. And that is happening around the country today, but that’s going to stop with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, okay?\nJessica: (22:22)\nThank you. Thank you, sir. And thank you for-\nVice President Mike Pence: (22:22)\nGreat question. Thank you.\nJessica: (22:23)\n… your service and your question with us here today.\nVice President Mike Pence: (22:26)\nThank you, Lieutenant.\nJessica: (22:29)\nThe focus of so much of the attention right now on safety and security, and quelling the violence and restoring law and order really hits home and it hits home to those of us that are mothers, that are raising kids, that are thinking about our future generations and thinking about the country that we will leave behind.\nVice President Mike Pence: (22:47)\nHow old are your little ones?\nJessica: (22:48)\nI have a seven year old son and a nine month old baby girl, so I have my house full. Thank you. And there’s [crosstalk 00:22:58] a number of families that have joined us here today, they’ve brought their kids. They too are concerned about the direction around safety and security in our neighborhoods. I’d like to introduce [Jen Fogle 00:23:10]. She’s our next testimony today. She’s a mother here in Des Moines. Jen, we’re so honored that you could join us. Please meet the Vice President and-\nJen Fogle: (23:20)\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to meet you.\nVice President Mike Pence: (23:20)\nThank you, Jen.\nJen Fogle: (23:23)\nAnd we’re trying to raise some boys who love God. They’re respectful and love history and their country. As a mother of four kids, it’s difficult and disheartening to watch the destruction happening across America and in some of our own communities. As we witness the diversity of thought come under attack, what is the Trump administration doing to improve educational opportunity for all Americans?\nVice President Mike Pence: (23:50)\nWell Jen, number one, these are your boys here? This is your family here? This is great. Stand up. What a beautiful family this is. Wonderful. Three boys, you have three boys?\nJen Fogle: (23:52)\nFour, actually.\nVice President Mike Pence: (24:05)\nOkay. I was going to ask, because I’m one of four boys, so I respect you even more. Thanks for a great question too. Well, let me address that question by simply saying that we’re going to continue to stand strong for all the values and ideals that have made this country great. And I really do believe that the American people are with us. The President often speaks about the silent majority, but I think the silent majority will be silent no more. I hear it and I see it. I read a good amount of my mail every day that comes to the White House and I hear people all the time talking about feeling, in a very real sense, their values, their traditions, their beliefs are under constant criticism by the mainstream media and by politicians on the left. But I really do believe the vast majority of the American people are proud of this country, are proud of law enforcement.\nVice President Mike Pence: (25:23)\nWe believe in faith, and family, and freedom and are going to step forward in roughly 80 days from now and support men and women that are standing for all of those timeless principles and ideals. I really do believe that the future’s never been brighter for this country. I mean, you think about what we’ve passed through as a nation. In our first three years, because this President rebuilt the military, largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And that means a special amount to me, because my son’s a United States Marine. And my son-in-law is a Navy Lieutenant and a pilot. And so, the investments that we’ve been able to be a part of and seen made have meant the world to us and made America safer.\nVice President Mike Pence: (26:10)\nBut to see an agenda to cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleashed America energy, supported ethanol in places like Iowa, negotiated the kind of free and fair trade of the US MCA. Stood tall on the world’s stage. You may have heard today, for the first time in more than 25 years, a major Arab country formerly recognized the state of Israel, the United Arab Emirates, today. And it’s because of strong leadership, but it’s also been leadership on values. I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life, for religious liberty, and has been appointing leaders and jurists to our courts at every level to defend those principles. And so, I just-\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:01)\nTo defend those principles. I just want to give you a word of encouragement. I truly do believe that if all of us will let our voice be heard in the days ahead, we’re going to solve the challenges in the time in which we live. We’re going to heal our land, and each and every day, we’re one day closer to the day we put the coronavirus in the past. We have a ways to go, but we’re going to continue to spare no expense. And to make sure that our health care workers, all of those that are struggling with the coronavirus and have the healthcare that we want any of our family members to have.\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:38)\nAnd can I just say thank you to the members of the law enforcement community. You’ve been there for families throughout this coronavirus pandemic and I thank you for your courageous and compassionate leadership in a challenging time for our nation. But I truly do believe as we see our economy starting to come back in the last three months, 9 million people have gone back to work, after we lost 22 million jobs. Let the American people know, that the strength of this nation is derived from our commitment to our national security to public safety. To commitment of freedom and free enterprise and the commitment to the ideals in life and liberties that have always been the well spring of American greatness.\nVice President Mike Pence: (28:23)\nAnd I truly do believe with four more years in the white house, people like Joni Ernst back in the United States Senate, we’re going to make America great again, again. For you and for these beautiful boys. Thank you.\nJessica: (28:45)\nThank you, sir. Thank you, Jen. Sir, we’ve got time for one more question to squeeze in here. Sergeant Chad Butler, he works for Shelby County Sheriff’s Office. He’s been in law enforcement for 21 years. Which is an incredible amount of service as well. Sir, I’d like to introduce you to Mr. Vice President, to ask your questions today.\nSgt. Chad Butler: (28:58)\nI’m very humble to meet you, Mr. Vice President. And want to thank you and President Trump for all you do for law enforcement across the country.\nVice President Mike Pence: (29:07)\nThank you, so much. It’s a privilege.\nSgt. Chad Butler: (29:09)\nThank you. As law enforcement officer, my personal concern about the future of safety and security in this country. What’s the Trump administration’s plan to reform policing in America?\nVice President Mike Pence: (29:19)\nWell first, join me in thanking the Sergeant for his career in public service. We are grateful for you. And I want to say to you, Sergeant and everybody in this room. You have the harder job. They only shoot at me with words. I want you to know. Your President and Vice President are grateful to you and admire you and respect you. I’m humbled to meet you. I really am. And I love your question as a stepping off point, because we’re absolutely committed to doing just that. I don’t know if a police officer that I ever met that didn’t want to get better at what you do. And that’s the reason why in the wake of the tragic murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, President Trump signed an executive order. It said, we’re not going to defund the police, we’re going to do the opposite. We’re going to fund the police with additional resources so that you can have more training on the use of force. More training in what you all call de-escalation efforts.\nVice President Mike Pence: (30:35)\nWe live in an increasingly complex security environment, particularly in our major cities. President Trump recognized that and said that rather than the defunding the police, we’re actually going to fund more training, more support for law enforcement. Combine that with the cops program, more law enforcement personnel on the streets, combine that with Operation Legend that I mentioned that will actually make federal personnel available to support local law enforcement. And that’s how we’ll improve. As I said, we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African American community or any of the families that are [inaudible 00:31:19]. That is a false choice. The choice America has made the last three and a half years under this President. The choice you’ve made here under Governor Kim Reynolds. The choice we’re going to make for four more years is we’re going to do both. We’re going to support our African American communities, we’re going to support educational opportunities. We support education and choice. This President supported the largest investment in historically black colleges and universities ever.\nVice President Mike Pence: (31:50)\nYou just heard Senator Joni Ernst reflect on my friend, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina. And he offered legislation, the President helped move through the House and Senate that actually is created more than 8,000, what are called opportunities zones in cities, across the country. They’re inviting investment in underserved areas and creating opportunities for people.\nVice President Mike Pence: (32:11)\nAnd I must tell you with that foundation I was just talking about of less taxes, less regulation and more fair trade and more exports, more American energy. We have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans in our first three years. And that we believe is the pathway forward, more support for law enforcement, for training, for resources, for personnel. A commitment to quell the violence on the streets. To make it clear to Governors and Mayors that if they don’t do their job, we will. And secondly is continue to support our African American neighbors, all of families in our cities to make sure that they have safer streets, better schools, more jobs and opportunities. That’s the pathway forward to bringing our country together. And making America great again, for every American. Thank you, Sergeant, thank you for that great question.\nJessica: (33:16)\nThank you, sir.\nVice President Mike Pence: (33:16)\nThank you, Jess.\nJessica: (33:19)\nSo the message today is simple: support law enforcement, return safety and security to our neighbors and we know that to do this and to do this well, that our elected officials need to hear from grassroots Americans all across the country. So with that in mind, today sir, we’re launching a police pledge. And we’re asking Americans from coast to coast to sign it. And it says that we will not support a bill, resolution or movement that seeks to defund the police. And so I’m asking every single one of you here today to sign this pledge at home, watching on our live stream to sign this pledge. And then to turn to your elected officials as the Vice President mentioned Mayors, Governors, city council, members of Congress, Senators all have a role to play as we quell the violence. Sign the police pledge and make this commitment not to defund the police.\nJessica: (34:16)\nYou can text 517776 now and sign the pledge today. So with that, we’ll end our time. Thank you, sir so much for being here. Thank you to our law enforcement officers, God bless you, God bless America.\nVice President Mike Pence: (34:29)\nJessica, thank you. Join me in thanking her [inaudible 00:34:33] and thanking all the incredible law enforcement officers and families that are here. Greatest honor of my life, to be your Vice President. God bless you all.', 'Joe Biden: (00:01)\nWe talked about school openings. We talked about the distribution of a vaccine, if and when one arrives, and what plans would be made for. We talked significantly about the racial disparities that exist and how COVID-19 is affecting different races differently, and we talked about the continued lack of PPE protective equipment and testing capacity and the like. I’ve put out a comprehensive plan over the last three months on each of these things, but today I want to talk about one thing. Very straightforward. Doesn’t have anything to do with Democrats, Republicans or independents. It has to do with a single simple proposition: every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum. Every governor should mandate. Every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing. The estimates by the experts are it will save over 40,000 lives in the next three months. 40,000 lives if people act responsibly.\nJoe Biden: (01:25)\nAnd it’s not about your rights, it’s about your responsibilities as an American. The fact is that as Americans are lining up to give blood, Americans volunteer all their time for food banks and local charities, supporting their neighbors that are in need. Well, this is no different. Wearing a mask is less about you contracting the virus, although it does help depending on the mask, but it’s about preventing other people from getting sick. Wearing a mask will give the life of a clerk or your local store or your letter carrier, your child’s teacher, it will increase their prospects of not contracting the virus. Even though it’s uncomfortable, we’re not used to it, wearing a mask is going to get our kids back to school sooner and safer. Wearing a mask, every American wearing a mask outdoors, is going to get our businesses back and the full strength long-term, and we’re going to get our country back on track.\nJoe Biden: (02:31)\nBut again, when I get occasionally confronted with a person in the public about wearing a mask, I say, “Look, this is America. Be a Patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Protect your fellow citizens. Step up. Do the right thing. Do the right thing.” There’s overwhelming evidence that the mask and depending on the type of mask you wear increases exponentially the prospect that you, if you are a carrier and you don’t even know it, that you will not infect anyone when you cough, sneeze, sing, shout.\nJoe Biden: (03:17)\nA lot of people are dying. We’re up over 160,000 people dead so far. And I’ll end by saying that it goes back to the study some months ago by Columbia University saying that we didn’t have to be this way. If the president had acted sooner, just one week earlier, it would have saved 30-some-thousand lives. Two weeks earlier, I think it was 51,000 or 57,000 lives. I hope we’ve learned a lesson. Hope the president has learned a lesson, but again, this is not about Democrat, Republican or independent. It’s about saving America’s lives, so let’s Institute a mass mandate nationwide starting immediately, and we will save lives. The estimates are we’ll save over 40,000 lives in the next three months if that is done.\nJoe Biden: (04:12)\nNow, let me turn it over to my colleague and running mate. She has a few comments to make. [inaudible 00:04:20].\nKamala Harris: (04:27)\nThanks, Joe. That’s what real leadership looks like. We just witnessed real leadership, which is Joe Biden said that as a nation, we should all be wearing a mask for the next three months, because it will save lives. And the thing about Joe that the American people know is that his role of leadership in our country has always been about doing what’s best for the people of our country, best for their health, their wellbeing, and for their families. That’s what real leadership looks like. And when Joe talks about his priorities, he knows and he cares about the fact that we have as a nation witnessed 165,000 people, who just in the last few months, have died in our country. We know that those individuals represent families, loved ones, grandparents, parents, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles of people who are mourning their loss every day, so what real leadership looks like is Joe Biden to speak up, sometimes telling us the stuff that we don’t necessarily want to hear, but we need to know.\nKamala Harris: (05:43)\nAnd the need for this mandatory mask wearing will also be about what Joe has articulated and what a Biden-Harris administration will do in terms of creating a pandemic testing board to get tens of millions of testing kits were needed to build a public health jobs corps, hiring at least 100,000 Americans to lead us through contact tracing as soon as we take office, and to chart a clear path forward for a safe and effective vaccine and guarantee every American, every American equal access to it by investing $25 billion, which is Joe’s plan. $25 billion in manufacturing and distribution. When Joe talks about this, I think it’s important that the American people looking at the election coming up ask the current occupant of the White House, “When am I going to get vaccinated? When am I actually going to get vaccinated?” Because there may be some grand gestures offered by the current president about a vaccine, but it really doesn’t matter until you can answer the question, “When am I going to get vaccinated?” So again, Joe Biden is about real leadership in our country, and I’m honored to be with you, Joe. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: (07:11)\nMr. Biden, can you tell us about your [inaudible 00:07:14]. What did she tell you? Anything on your [crosstalk 00:07:20].\nJoe Biden: (07:16)\nWe’ll talk about that later.', 'Joe Biden: (17:08)\nPlease welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris.\nJoe Biden: (17:27)\nHello hello. Thanks for being here. I wish we were able to talk to the folks outside but we’re keeping our social distancing and playing by the rules. Good afternoon everyone. To me and to Kamala, this is an exciting day. It’s a great day for our campaign and it’s a great day for America in my view. Over the past several weeks I have had the incredible privilege of meeting and spending a good deal of time with a group of talented women leaders, all of whom are qualified to be president. With each one, the more I learned about them, the more I talked to them, the more impressed I was even though I knew them before. I want to thank each and every one of them for being part of this process and I look forward to working with them as we rebuild this country to get elected and once we are elected God willing.\nJoe Biden: (18:27)\nI approached this with a seriousness of purpose and of mind because this is a serious moment for our nation. We’re at one of those inflection points, you’ve heard me say that before, in our history. A life-changing election for this nation and the choice, the choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time and I had a great choice. Great opportunities. I had a great choice but I have no doubt that I picked the right person to join me as the next Vice President of the United States of America and that’s Senator Kamala Harris. You know, it seems Americans all across this nation, at least at the outset here agree with me. Yesterday we had our best grassroots fundraising day of the campaign, more than double our previous record, and in doing so, we set a single day record for online political fundraising and I think I know why. So I hope that you’ll join us as well, those of you listening today. Go to joebiden.com today, $5.00, $10.00, whatever.\nJoe Biden: (19:45)\nKamala, as you all know is smart, she’s tough, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class, for all those who are struggling to get into the middle class. Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. She’s ready to do this job on Day One and we’re both ready to get to work, rebuilding this nation and building it better. As attorney general of the largest state in the country, Kamala took on the big banks over mortgage fraud and won. Took on big oil that wanted to pollute without consequences. She was a pioneer in marriage equality and tackled the gun lobby. You know, we’ve all watched her in the United States Senate go toe to toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that needed to be asked and not stopping until she got an answer and when none was forthcoming it was obvious what the answer was.\nJoe Biden: (20:51)\nAs a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, she’s been the center, in the middle of the most critical national security challenges our country faces. Well aware, well aware of all the threats to this nation and ready to respond to them. As a child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up black and Indian-American in the United States of America. Her story is America’s story, different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials. She has worked hard, she has never backed down from a challenge, and she has earned each and every of the accolades and achievements that she has gained. Many of them often in the face of obstacles that others put in her way but never quit, and this morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today, today just maybe, they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way, as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents.\nJoe Biden: (22:20)\nIn her campaign in the primary, Kamala often talked about what she referred to as the 3:00 a.m. agenda, about moms and dads awake late at night in their kitchens, worried, scared, uncertain about how they were going to take care of their families, about how they were going to pay the bills, about how they were going to make it, simply make it. Growing up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, I saw that struggle with my family as well. Kamala saw it with hers as well and millions of Americans are living that struggle as we speak, especially in this moment of crisis, especially with so many jobs lost. Kamala and I both know that all folks are looking for as my dad would say is an even shot, just give me a shot, a fair shot, a shot at making it and it will be the work of our administration to make sure they get a fair shot.\nJoe Biden: (23:24)\nWorking families need someone on their side in this nation because they certainly don’t have anyone in the president now on their side. That’s going to change in a Biden-Harris administration. It’s going to be gratifying to see the strong, enthusiastic reaction to Senator Harris as our next vice president. It comes from people all over the country, it’s already occurring. All over the country, all ideological views, all backgrounds. Events of course, we are predictable, some of them. It comes from all over except of course from Donald Trump’s White House and his allies. You all knew it was coming. You could have set your watches to it. Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala “nasty”, whining about how she is “mean” to his appointees. It’s no surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history.\nJoe Biden: (24:37)\nIs anyone surprised Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman or strong women across the board? We know that more is to come, so let’s be clear. If you’re a working person, worried about whether or not you have a job to go to, whether or not you’ll be able to pay your mortgage, pay your rent, worried about the poison in the air you breathe, the water you drink, worried about your civil rights, even your basic right to dignity which is under attack with this administration, Kamala Harris has had your back and now we have to have her back. She’s going to stand with me in this campaign and all of us are going to stand up for her. On January 20, 2021, we’re all going to watch Senator Harris raise her right hand and swear the oath of office as the first woman ever to serve in the second highest office in America in this land, and then we’re going to get to work, fixing the mess that President Trump and Vice President Pence have created, both at home and abroad through four years of mismanagement and coddling of terrorists and thugs around the world. Not only will America dig itself out of this hole they put us in, we’re going to build. We’re going to build back and we’re going to build back better. We have a public health crisis. While he’s in court trying to do away with health care, with more than five million reported infections, 165,000 people dead and climbing as a consequence of COVID-19 and still, months later, no real leadership or plan from the President of the United States how to get this pandemic under control. No real help for the states and local governments trying to fill the vacuum of leadership from the White House. No real help for children and educators, for small businesses and frontline workers, they’re the ones that are holding our country together. Instead, he’s issuing executive orders and making promises that in the end will defund the Social Security system while insisting that this virus will disappear.\nJoe Biden: (27:12)\nThe Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration will have a comprehensive plan to meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. Masking, clear science-based guidance, dramatically scaling up testing, getting states and local governments the resources they need to open the schools and businesses safely. We can do this. We just need a president and vice president willing to lead and take responsibility. Not as this president says, “It’s not my fault. The governor should thank me more.” As that old saying goes, give me a break. We have an economic crisis and more than 16 million Americans, 16 million, still out of work. Donald Trump is on track to break another record. On track to leave office with the worst jobs records of any American president in modern history, but instead of doing the hard work, of meeting face to face with congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans in the White House like every other president has done in a crisis, to get Americans the relief they need and deserve, Donald Trump is on the golf course. If I told you this three years ago you’d look at me like I was being crazy. He hasn’t even met with the leadership. He doesn’t have time it appears.\nJoe Biden: (28:58)\nWe have a climate crisis that Donald Trump refuses to even acknowledge. When he thinks about climate change, all we hear is the word hoax. A Biden-Harris administration is going to meet the climate crisis, protect the health of the American public. Along the way, we’re going to deliver one word, jobs. Good paying jobs. We have a racial justice crisis. Donald Trump seeks only to inflame it with his politics of racist rhetoric and appeals to division. Today’s not only the day I’m proud to introduce Senator Kamala Harris as the vice presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. It’s also the third anniversary of that terrible day in Charlottesville. Remember? Remember what it felt like to see those neo-Nazis, close your eyes, and those Klansmen, white supremacists, coming\nJoe Biden: (30:03)\n… close your eyes, and those Klansmen, white supremacists, coming out of fields, carrying lighted torches, faces contorted, bulging veins, pouring into the streets of a historic American city, spewing the same antisemitic bile we heard in Hitler’s Germany in the ’30s. Remember how it felt to see a violent clash ensue between those celebrating hate and those standing against it? It was a wake up call for all of us as a country. For me, it was a call to action. My father used to say, silence is complicity, not original to him, but he believed it. At that moment, I knew I couldn’t stand by and let Donald Trump, a man who went on to say when asked about what he thought he said, there were very fine people on both sides, “Very fine people on both sides.” No president of the United States of America has ever said anything like that, see him continuing to attack everything that makes America America. I knew we were in the battle for the soul of the nation. That’s when I decided to run. I’m proud now to have Senator Harris at my side in that battle because she shares with the same intensity I do, for she’s someone who knows what’s at stake.\nJoe Biden: (31:37)\nThe question is for all Americans to answer, who are we as a nation? What do we stand for? And most importantly, what do we want to be? Someone who knows that the future of this country is limited only by the barriers we place on our own imaginations because there’s nothing Americans cannot achieve what we put our minds to it and we do it together.\nJoe Biden: (32:09)\nOne of the reasons I chose Kamala is because we both believe that we can define America simply in one word, possibilities. Possibilities. Let me say it again, possibilities. That’s America. That’s what sets this nation apart, is that everyone, everyone, the ability for everyone, and we mean everyone, to go as far and dream as big as hard work and their God-given ability will take them.\nJoe Biden: (32:48)\nWhen I agreed to serve as President Obama’s running mate, he asked me a number of questions, as I’ve asked Kamala, but the most important was he asked me, what I wanted most importantly. I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions. That’s what I asked Kamala, I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, which she will, challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, ask the hard questions because that’s the way we make the best decisions for the American people. I got a chance to spend some time at my home today with Kamala and Doug, and I want to thank them. I thanked them then, but thank them publicly for agreeing to join and take this journey with Jill and me. Doug, you’re going to have to learn what it means to be a barrier breaker yourself in this job you’re about to take on, America’s first Second Gentlemen. And although they’re not with us here today, I want to thank Ella and Cole as well.\nJoe Biden: (34:07)\nI had a chance to speak to Doug’s mom and dad, and Ella and Cole, and we’re going to get our kids together to let them know what’s coming. My grandchildren are about the age of their children. I got to speak to them. My campaign has always been a family affair, every campaign I’ve run. So I’ve got some news for you, you’re all honorary Bidens. And here’s the best part, Kamala, you’ve been an honorary Biden for quite some time.\nJoe Biden: (34:47)\nI came first to know who Kamala was through our son, Beau Biden. They were friends. They served as attorneys general at the same time. They took on the same big fights together, Kamala in California, Beau here in Delaware. Big fights that helped change the entire country. I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work, and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision. So now we need to get to work, pulling this nation out of these crises we find ourselves in, getting our economy back on track, uniting this nation, and yes, winning the battle for the soul of America. My fellow Americans, now let me introduce to you for the first time, your next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. Kamala, the floor is yours.\nKamala Harris: (35:57)\n[inaudible 00:35:57] Thank you, Joe.\nJoe Biden: (36:03)\nThank you.\nKamala Harris: (36:04)\nThank you, Joe. As I said, Joe, when you called me, I am incredibly honored by this responsibility and I’m ready to get to work. I’m ready to get to work.\nKamala Harris: (36:19)\nAfter the most competitive primary in history, the country received a resounding message that Joe was the person to lead us forward. Joe, I’m so proud to stand with you. I do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible. This is a moment of real consequence for America. Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it’s all on the line. We’re reeling from the worst public health crisis in a century. The president’s mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and we’re experiencing a moral reckoning with racism and systemic injustice that has brought a new coalition of conscience to the streets of our country, demanding change. America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. A president who is making every challenge we face even more difficult to solve.\nKamala Harris: (37:58)\nBut here’s the good news, we don’t have to accept the failed government of Donald Trump and Mike Pence in just 83 days. We have a chance to choose a better future for our country. So Joe, Dr. Biden, thank you for the trust you’ve placed in me. Jill, I know you will be an incredible First Lady. My husband, Doug, and I are so grateful to become a part of your extended family.\nKamala Harris: (38:39)\nEver since I received Joe’s call, I’ve been thinking, yes, about the first Biden that I really came to know, and that of course is Joe’s beloved son, one of his beloved sons, Beau. In the midst of the Great Recession, Beau and I spoke on the phone practically every day, sometimes multiple times a day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks of the nation that were foreclosing on people’s homes.\nKamala Harris: (39:14)\nLet me just tell you about Beau Biden. I learned quickly that Beau was the kind of guy who inspired people to be a better version of themselves. He really was the best of us. And when I would ask him, “Where did you get that? Where did this come from?” He’d always talk about his dad. I will tell you the love that they shared was incredible to watch. It was the most beautiful display of the love between a father and a son. Beau talked about how Joe would spend four hours every day riding the rails back and forth from Wilmington to Washington so he could make breakfast for his kids in the morning and make it home in time to tuck them in bed each night. All of this so two little boys, who had just lost their mom and their sister in a tragic accident, would know that the world was still turning, and that’s how I came to know Joe.\nKamala Harris: (40:26)\nHe’s someone whose first response when things get tough is never to think about himself, but to care for everyone else. He’s someone who never asks, why is this happening to me? And instead asks, what can I do to make life better for you? His empathy, his compassion, his sense of duty to care for others is why I am so proud to be on this ticket.\nKamala Harris: (41:03)\nJoe and I, yes, we are cut from the same cloth, family is everything to me too. I cannot wait for America to get to know my husband, Doug, and our amazing kids, Cole and Ella. Because whether I’m cheering in the bleachers at a swim meet, or setting up a college room dorm, or helping my goddaughter prepare for her school debate, or building Legos with my godson, or hugging my two baby nieces, or cooking dinner, Sunday dinner, my family means everything to me. I’ve had a lot of titles over my career, and certainly vice president will be great, but Mamala will always be the one that means the most.\nKamala Harris: (41:51)\nMy mother and father, they came from opposite sides of the world to arrive in America, one from India and the other from Jamaica, in search of a world-class education. But what brought them together was the civil rights movement of the 1960s. That’s how they met, as students in the streets of Oakland, marching and shouting for this thing called justice in a struggle that continues today, and I was part of it. My parents would bring me to protests, strapped tightly in my stroller. My mother, Shyamala, raised my sister, Maya, and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of Americans to keep on marching. She’d tell us, “Don’t sit around and complain about things, do something.” So I did something, I devoted my life to making real the words carved in the United States Supreme Court, equal justice under law.\nKamala Harris: (42:59)\n30 years ago, I stood before a judge for the first time, breathed deep and uttered the phrase that would truly guide my career and the rest of my career, Kamala Harris for the people. The people, that’s who I represented as district attorney, fighting on behalf of victims who needed help. The people, that’s who I fought for as California’s Attorney General when I took on transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings. And it’s the people who I have fought for as the United States Senator where I’ve worked every day to hold Trump officials accountable to the American people. And the people are who Joe and I will fight for every day in the White House.\nKamala Harris: (43:52)\nLet me tell you, as somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut. Just look where they’ve gotten us, more than 16 million out of work, millions of kids who cannot go back to school, a crisis of poverty, of homelessness afflicting black, brown, and indigenous people the most, a crisis of hunger afflicting one in five mothers who have children that are hungry and tragically, more than 165,000 lives that have been cut short, many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye. It didn’t have to be this way. Six years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis, it was called Ebola. We all remember that pandemic, but you know what happened then? Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job, only two-\nKamala Harris: (45:03)\n… and Joe Biden did their job. Only two people in the United States died. Two. That is what’s called leadership. But compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now. When other countries are following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. While other countries were flattening the curve, he said the virus would just poof, go away, quote, like a miracle. So when other countries opened back up for business, what did we do? We had to shut down again. This virus has impacted almost every country, but there’s a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It’s because of Trump’s failure to take it seriously from the start, his refusal to get testing up and running, his flip flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts.\nKamala Harris: (46:17)\nAll of that is reason. And the reason that an American dies of COVID-19 every 80 seconds. It’s why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good. It’s why there is complete chaos over when and how to reopen our schools. Mothers and fathers are confused and uncertain and angry about childcare and the safety of their kids at school. Whether they will be in danger if they go, or fall behind if they don’t. Trump is also the reason millions of Americans are now unemployed. He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground. Because of Trump’s failures of leadership, our economy has taken one of the biggest hits out of all the major industrialized nations with an unemployment rate that has tripled as of today. This is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn’t up for the job. Our country ends up in tatters, and so does our reputation around the world.\nKamala Harris: (47:51)\nBut let’s be clear. This election isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump or Mike Pence. It’s about building this country back better. And that’s exactly what Joe and I will do. We’ll create millions of jobs and fight climate change through a clean energy revolution, bring back critical supply chains so the future is made in America, build on the affordable care act. So everyone has a peace of mind that comes with health insurance, and finally offer caregivers the dignity, the respect, and the pay they deserve. We’ll protect a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her own body, root out systemic racism in our justice system, and pass a new voting rights act. A John Lewis voting rights act that will ensure every voice is heard and every voice is counted.\nKamala Harris: (48:55)\nThe civil rights struggle is nothing new to Joe. It’s why he got into public service. It’s why he helped reauthorize the voting rights act and restore unemployment discrimination and employment discrimination laws. And today, he takes his place in the ongoing story of America’s march toward equality and justice, as the only, as the only who has served alongside the first black president and has chosen the first black woman as his running mate. But as Joe always points out, this election is about more than politics. It’s about who we are as a country. And I’ll admit over the past four years, there have been moments when I have truly worried about our future. But whenever I think that there is a reason for doubt, whenever I’ve had my own doubts, I think of you, the American people, the doctors and nurses and frontline workers who are risking your lives to save others, the truck drivers and the workers in grocery stores, in factories, in farms, working there, putting your own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic. The women and students taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers. The dreamers and immigrants who know that families belong together. The LGBTQ Americans who know that love is love. People of every age and color and creed who are finally declaring in one voice that yes, black lives matter.\nKamala Harris: (50:38)\nAll across this country, a whole new generation of children is growing up hearing the cries for justice and the chance of hope on which I was raised. Some strapped into strollers of their own. And trust me, it’s a song you’ll never forget. So to everyone, keeping up the fight, you are doing something. You are doing something great. You are the heroes of our time and you are the reason I know we are going to bring our country closer to realizing its great promise, but to do it, we’ll need to work, organize and vote like never before, because we need more than a victory on November 3rd. We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be.\nKamala Harris: (51:36)\nJoe likes to say that character is on the ballot. And it’s true. When he saw what happened in Charlottesville three years ago today, he knew we were in a battle for the soul of our nation. And together with your help, that’s a battle we will win. Earlier this year, I said, “I do whatever Joe asks me to do.” And so now I’m asking you to do the same. So visit joebiden.com to get involved in this campaign and vote, because electing Joe Biden is just the start of the work ahead of us. And I couldn’t be prouder to be by his side, running to represent you, the people. Thank you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.', 'Doug Ducey: (00:00)\n… only vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. Now, before we hear from the vice president, I want to remind everyone why it’s absolutely critical this November that we stand in strong support for the leaders who have fought so hard for us. Since the out set of this administration, President Donald J. Trump and Vice President, Mike Pence have been stead fast partners to the state of Arizona. During the COVID-19 crisis, whenever we needed anything from personal protective equipment to ventilators, to surge capacity on the Navajo nation, to testing and more, this administration has been there to help. And this administration has also helped set the stage for what has been a booming economy in the State of Arizona and it will set the stage for Arizona to come back even stronger than ever.\nDoug Ducey: (01:12)\nFrom the USMCA to the tax cut and JOBS Act, to TSMC, to the historic regulatory reform that is cleared out red tape in front of our entrepreneurs and innovators. Some people think it doesn’t matter who’s in office, but I can tell you the difference has been night and day for the State of Arizona. This is an administration that cares about our state and stands at the ready and is always just a phone call away. And I also think that President Donald Trump and Vice President Pence both in their official capacity and as candidates have visited the state of Arizona more than any other presidential administration in the history of our country. They like it here and we like having them here. It’s incredibly refreshing to actually experience a federal government that listens to the states instead of making things harder.\nDoug Ducey: (02:35)\nI’ve got a clear line of communication on behalf of our state with Vice President Pence, President Trump, and just know that Arizona’s wants, needs and concerns are being heard. We have a partnership with this administration and it’s a partnership we intend to continue for four more years. So to every person here today, we need you take action and make certain that we turn out in November at the ballot box and that we reelect President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence back to the White House for four more years. And with that ladies and gentlemen, it’s my great privilege and let’s give a warm Arizona welcome to my friend and the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence.\nDoug Ducey: (03:42)\n(singing)\nMike Pence: (03:42)\nWell, hello Arizona. The governor, Doug Ducey, who’s just doing a phenomenal job here in Arizona. Can we hear it for this great governor? Thank you for that great introduction. The Senator Martha McSally, to Utah attorney general, Sean Reyes, to several distinguished members of Congress and all my fellow Americans from near and far, it is great to be back in the Grand Canyon state for the launch of Latter-day Saints for Trump. And all the families of Arizona’s LDS community gathered here and all of those that are looking on, we are honored by your support and grateful for your prayers. And we’re honored to be here with so many champions of faith and family and freedom like that man I just mentioned who’s led Arizona to prosperity and led Arizona through these challenging times. Just join me in thanking governor Doug Ducey one more time, will you? He is a truly remarkable leader. Or like a history making combat veteran who’s now defending freedom every day in the halls of the United States Senate, join me in thanking your current and future Senator, Senator Martha McSally.\nMike Pence: (05:52)\nOr like a group of leaders who I can tell you firsthand have stood in the gap with our president and for conservative values every single day of this administration, would you join me in thanking four amazing members of Congress, Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, Congressman David Schweikert, Congressman Paul Gosar and Congressman Andy Biggs. I served in the House of Representatives for 12 years before I went home to be governor of Indiana. It was 12 years and I have to tell you it seemed longer, but it is a remarkable thing when you see men and women who carry the very same principles that carried them to Washington DC. And I have to tell, you those that are gathered here, Arizona should be proud of the principled conservative delegation that you’ve sent to Washington DC. They make a difference every day. They really do. It really is great to be with so many friends. And speaking of friends, allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from another friend of mine who loves the state of Arizona.\nMike Pence: (07:19)\nAnd when I told him I was headed your way last night, I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. So allow me to be in greetings from a champion of life and liberty and the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. It really is great to be with all of you today but I got to be honest with you, I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Arizona and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops. And it’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp. I don’t know if you all heard the news, but on the way here I just heard that Joe Biden named his running mate. California Senator Kamala Harris will be the Democrat candidate for vice president.\nMike Pence: (08:56)\nSo let me take this opportunity to welcome her to the race. I mean, we all know, look, Joe Biden and the Democratic party have been overtaken by the radical left. So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and abortion on demand, it’s no surprise that he chose Senator Harris to be his running back. You all might like to know that the vice presidential debate is going to be held on October 7th in Utah. So my message to the Democrat candidate for vice president, congratulations, I’ll see you in Salt Lake City. I remember the day that I got the call to join this ticket. It’s about four years ago, this time. Karen and I had prayed all the way through it and I said yes in a heartbeat because I knew then that Donald Trump had the vision, the leadership and the strength to make America great again and in four short years that’s just what we’ve done.\nMike Pence: (10:18)\nI mean, from the first day of this administration, President Trump has been working to keep the promises that he made to the people of Arizona and people all across this country, especially this president has worked every day, I can attest, to keep the promises that he has made to people of faith. We’ve stood for the sanctity of life without apology. We’ve stood for religious liberty of every American of every faith. We’ve made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. We’ve rebuilt our military and restored the arts in all of democracy. I have to tell you, as the proud father of a United States Marine who’s stationed right here in Arizona and as the proud father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot, I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president who has so supported the men and women of our armed forces.\nMike Pence: (11:23)\nWe’re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and coast guard, the resources and the support they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation. True. And this president has also appointed more conservatives to our court of appeals than any president in American history. In the midst of all of that, in our first three years, with the strong support of these conservatives in the Congress, we revived the American economy with less taxes, less regulation, more American energy-\nMike Pence: (12:03)\n… is less regulation, more American energy and the kind of trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first.\nMike Pence: (12:11)\nIt’s amazing. In those first three years this president kept all the promises that he made to the people of Arizona and then some. We cut those taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. In fact, this president signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any president in American history, and the USMCA is now the law of the land. It’s a win for American and win for Arizona.\nMike Pence: (12:43)\nWe unleashed American energy and in the midst of all of that, in those first three years, American business created more than seven million good paying jobs. And then the Coronavirus pandemic hit. And it’s been a challenging time. Especially over the last several months here in the state of Arizona. Early in this pandemic, the American people saw the leadership of President Trump shine forth. This president marshaled not only a whole of government response, but a whole of America response. We reinvented testing and now America has done more testing for the Coronavirus than any nation on earth. We arranged for the manufacture and delivery of hundreds of millions of medical supplies to all of the incredible healthcare workers in hospitals all across this country. We’ve been working around the clock since February of this year developing medicines known as therapeutics at a record pace, and I’m proud to say that we are well on our way to having the first Coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year. Now, we have a ways to go, and we all have a role to play to protect the vulnerable, to save lives, and I know the people of Arizona will continue to do that. There’s not a day gone by since the president tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus task force that I haven’t thought of the families that have suffered loss. Today our hearts are with the more than 160,000 American families that have lost loved ones. But our hearts are also filled with gratitude, to the amazing first responders, the amazing doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers who have been nothing less than heroic all through this pandemic. They have our thanks.\nMike Pence: (14:48)\nNow, let me say to the people of Arizona, we’re encouraged by the progress that you’re making in the Grand Canyon State, and the progress we’re seeing all across the sunbelt. Because of this presidents’ leadership and all of our efforts, because of the strong leadership here in the state of Arizona in this challenging time. I continue to receive reports that cases are coming down in Arizona. Positive tests are coming down and the economy is coming back. Thank you Governor Doug Ducey for your strong, steady, and compassionate leadership.\nMike Pence: (15:25)\nAnd the economy is coming back. It’s amazing to think, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, because of the solid foundation that our president poured in those first three years of less government, less taxes, more free and fair trade, more American energy, the American comeback has begun. And from that 22 million lost, we’ve already added 9.3 million jobs back to the American economy and we’re just getting started.\nMike Pence: (15:56)\nWe’re opening up America again and we’re opening up America’s schools. I’ll get you back. And I want to make you a promise and the governor knows we mean it, as you in the Grand Canyon State and people all across the country continue to contend with this pandemic; we will not rest, we will not relent, we will spare no expense and no effort until Arizona and America put the Coronavirus in the past and bring this state and nation back bigger and better than ever before. We’ll do it.\nMike Pence: (16:47)\nBut to do that we all need to continue to do our part. To bring America all the way back. And to do that, we also need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. My fellow Americans we’re passing through a time of testing. But soon we will come to a time for choosing. And the choice in this election has never been clearer.\nMike Pence: (17:21)\nThe stakes have never been higher. It’s really why I’m here today. I want to talk about what’s at stake. I want to talk about the choice our nation faces. I’m here to talk about faith in America and keeping faith with everything that’s always made America good and great. To families here in Arizona, in the LDS community, make no mistake about it, our economic recovery is on the ballot, but also there are things on the ballot more fundamental and more foundational to our country as well. I think this coming election, the choice is not going to be whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, whether America will be more Democrat or more Republican, more red or blue. The choice in this election is whether America remains America.\nMike Pence: (18:23)\nIt’s whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country that’s grounded in our highest ideals, of freedom, free markets, and the inalienable right to life and liberty. Or whether we will leave to our children and grandchildren a country that’s fundamentally transformed into something else.\nSpeaker 1: (18:47)\nNo way.\nMike Pence: (18:47)\nNo way are we going to let that happen. I mean, you get it. We stand at a crossroads of freedom. Before us lie two paths, one based on the dignity and worth of every individual, and the other on the growing control of the state. One road leads to greater freedom and opportunity for every American. The other road leads to socialism and decline.\nMike Pence: (19:18)\nWell, I know the American people. Just as Arizona did in 2016, are going to choose freedom and opportunity when we re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years.\nMike Pence: (19:39)\nJoe Biden and the radical Democrats would set America on a path of socialism and decline, make no mistake about it. President Trump set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity from our very first day in office. It’s really amazing when you look at their agenda. In the midst of a global pandemic, Joe Biden would raise taxes by four trillion dollars. By contrast, President Donald Trump cut taxes across the board for the American people and we’re going to keep delivering tax relief to working Americans and businesses large and small.\nMike Pence: (20:27)\nJoe Biden would bury the economy under an avalanche of red tape, more regulation, more bureaucracy. And as I told you before, this president’s actually cut more federal red tape than any president in American history, and we’re just getting started.\nMike Pence: (20:46)\nAnd Joe Biden even has a two trillion dollar plan to abolish fossil fuels. He’d rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and implement his own version of the Green New Deal. President Trump has pursued an all of the above energy strategy that’s driving an American energy renaissance. He’s made our nation nearly energy independent for the first time in 75 years. We’re a net exporter of energy to the world.\nMike Pence: (21:19)\nAnd it’s not just a choice at home. It’s the contrast of leadership on the world stage. The American people need to remember that Joe Biden was a leading voice of appeasement toward Iran. And the Iran Nuclear Deal. President Donald Trump got us out of the Iran Nuclear Deal and Qasem Soleimani is gone.\nMike Pence: (21:58)\nAnd where four previous administrations made promises to the American people about our most cherished ally, it was President Donald trump who kept his promise. When he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem the capital of the state of Israel.\nMike Pence: (22:17)\nSo this president has stood with our allies and stood up to our enemies. Closer to home, President Donald trump has stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day.\nMike Pence: (22:36)\nYou know Joe Biden actually said that he believes America is in his words, “Systemically racist.” And that law enforcement has again, and I quote, ” An implicit bias against minorities.”\nMike Pence: (23:05)\nWhen Joe Biden was asked whether he would cut funding to law enforcement he said, yes, absolutely. Well President Trump and I know what you all know. The men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement all across this country are the best people in America. As I just told a gathering down in Tucson of Cops for Trump, with this president and this administration, we’ll always back the blue. And we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever.\nMike Pence: (24:03)\nGoing to defund the police not now, not ever. Despite what Joe Biden in the radical left think, American people know law enforcement isn’t the problem. Law enforcement is the solution. We don’t need to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our minority communities. This president has done both every single day and we will continue to support law enforcement and support our minority communities with Liberty and justice for all. And on issues most important to people of faith across this country, issues like life and religious Liberty. Joe Biden and the radical left are deeply out of step with the American people.\nMike Pence: (25:21)\nI’m proud to tell you though, this president has stood for the religious freedom of every American of every faith every day of this administration. As the president said not long ago, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as Americans. He said we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe in faith and family, not in government and bureaucracy and we live by the words of our national motto in God We Trust. Here at this inaugural event for latter day saints for Trump I want assure all of you, you have a president, you have a vice president, an entire administration that understand that the greatness of America doesn’t come from the corridors of government or even our bustling factories. It comes from the character and faith of the American people.\nMike Pence: (27:18)\nThat’s why in one instance after another from the first day of this administration, we’ve been defending freedom and defending the values that we all cherish every day. I mean from the very first days of this administration president Trump kept his word. When he ended the enforcement of the Johnson amendment and freed up pulpits all across America, the freedom of speech will not end at the front door of your church or synagogue or place of worship ever again. And where Joe Biden has actually promised to reimpose Obamacare mandates on religious institutions, president Trump ended the assault on the little sisters of the poor two years ago. And a few days back the Supreme court ended it forever by a seven to two vote. And then there was the Peace Cross in Maryland. It was literally constructed decades ago to honor fallen heroes in world war one. But the left wing radical activists wanted to take it down. President Trump stepped in, we stood strong, we went to the Supreme court and one more seven to two vote the Peace Cross is standing today. And believe it or not under the last administration Bibles were actually being removed from VA hospital rooms and even displays. I heard about it a few years back, there was a display on what’s called a missing man table in the lobby of a VA hospital in New Hampshire. And some liberal group sent a letter and said that you got to take that army issued Bible off the table. And president Trump said the Bible stays and we issued a new policy. Not only allowed the display of Bibles at VA hospitals, we made it sure that Christmas carols and prayers and gatherings can happen in every VA hospital in America. We’re going to defend the freedom of religion of all of our veterans of every faith.\nMike Pence: (30:18)\nAnd standing strong for religious Liberty and I’m proud to report to you that this president has already appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And I can tell you they are all men and women who will uphold all the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. 200 judges.\nMike Pence: (30:55)\nAnd none of that would have been possible without the strong, consistent, principled support of Republicans in the United States Senate, and especially Senator Martha McSally. Thank you for supporting conservatives to our courts at every level. We’ve made so much progress over the last three and a half years strengthening the constitutional foundations of our federal courts. But I’m going to have to tell all of you gathered here that over the last month we’ve been reminded that we have work to do. Whether it was that five four decision that struck down Louisiana’s pro-life law or whether it was the incomprehensible five, four decision that said that the churches could face greater restrictions than casinos. One thing is clear, we need more conservatives on the Supreme court of the United States. So we need four more years of president Donald Trump in the white house.\nMike Pence: (32:28)\nI mean that’s exactly why this president announced not long ago, what he announced four years ago, come September we’re going to release the list of principled conservative nominees that the president will draw any future nominee to the highest court in the land in the second term. He kept his word before he’ll keep his word again. And if the opportunity presents itself in the next four years, I promise you this president will appoint strong principled, conservative men and women to the Supreme court of the United States. And beyond all of that, while Joe Biden is advancing a social agenda of the radical left by contrast president Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history. It’s true.\nMike Pence: (33:25)\nAnd from the first day of this administration this president, our administration have stood without apology to the sanctity of life. He was literally in office less than a week when he re-instituted, what’s known as the Mexico city policy. Which ensures that no taxpayer dollars will ever be spent to provide or promote abortion abroad and one year later he expanded it. By contrast Joe Biden and the radical left support abortion on demand. They even support taxpayer funding of abortion. Even though throughout his career Joe Biden supported what is known as the Hyde amendment, which has historically prevented your taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortion. With pressure from the radical left, Joe Biden abandoned his historic position.\nMike Pence: (34:38)\nAnd now he’s pledging to use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion at home and abroad and is calling for historic increases in funding to planned Parenthood. Joe Biden and the democratic party also support late term abortion. And Democrats in the Senate even blocked a bill that would require medical care for children that survive abortions. By contrast, this president has consistently defended the vulnerable, he’s consistently defended the unborn, he’s consistently stood for the sanctity of life and we always will. This president has called on Congress to outlaw late term abortion once and for all. And I must tell you, it was one of the proudest moments for your vice-president is the day that I had the privilege of sitting in the chair in the United States Senate and being given the opportunity to cast the tie breaking vote to allow states across the country to defund planned Parenthood. And president Donald-\nMike Pence: (36:03)\nUnplanned Parenthood and President Donald Trump signed the bill into law. So for all he’s done for life and religious liberty here at this kickoff event of Latter-Day Saints for Trump, for all he’s done for people of faith, of every faith across America. Men and women in Arizona, we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the white house.\nGroup: (36:39)\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\nMike Pence: (36:58)\nIt really is great to be with you today. In fact, it’s a blessing. A blessing to be able to be with you today, to share this moment and to share this story. I want to tell you, I appreciate Governor Ducey’s kind introduction, but he’s known me a little while. He knows my values. He knows the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter.\nMike Pence: (37:21)\nI’m a Christian, a conservative and a Republican in that order. And I am honored to be with you today. And that’s why it means so much to me to be Vice President to a President who’s been such a steadfast defender of life and family and faith and freedom. Before I leave, let me also just take this opportunity. Let me take this opportunity to just say thank you to all of you. Thank you for your support, for your encouragement. Thank you for giving my little family the opportunity to serve you as Vice President of the United States. It’s the greatest honor of my life. It is.\nMike Pence: (38:27)\nAll of you gathered here at Latter-Day Saints for Trump also know well, the foundation of America is freedom. But the foundation of freedom is faith. As President John Adams, our first Vice President said long ago, and I quote, “Our constitution was designed only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.” As I’ve traveled across this country over the last four years, I’m more convinced than ever in my 61st year of two things. That America is a freedom loving nation. And America is a nation of faith. People across this country know how precious freedom is. I see the passion in this room. I see it everywhere I go all across the country. On street corners, in conversations from sea to shining sea.\nMike Pence: (39:46)\nI mean, I know we’ve got a tough fight ahead of us. But it only means the prize is going to be more glorious. And I hope you all see yourselves as a part of the great American story. The story we’re writing today is a story of promises made and promises kept. It’s a story of renewing American strength. It’s a story of creating jobs, renewing the American dream, and opportunity for every American. And in these challenging times, it’s a story of American character and resilience and faith. Law and order protecting all that’s made this country strong and prosperous and good, but like any unfinished story, the rest is up to us. From this day forward, every day that remains between now and election day.\nMike Pence: (40:48)\nWe’ve all got to do our part. We’ve got to go tell the story and lay a foundation to write the next chapter. We’ve got to tell all the wonderful families across this state and in this community about all the progress that we’ve made. I mean, tell them what we’ve done for life and liberty. Tell them what they’re not hearing on most of their major cable television networks. And tell them it’s time. It’s time to write the next chapter of American greatness. It’s time to re-elect President Donald Trump for four more years. Go tell them. And this, I know you will do because the American people have never stopped. From those days when I was first added to this ticket, the summer of 2016 and every day since, I’ve seen the way the American people reached out and took hold of their future. You knew we could be strong again. You knew we could be prosperous again.\nMike Pence: (42:10)\nYou’ve talked to your neighbors and your friends at work and at worship. And we made history in 2016, and we’re going to make history again in 2020. I know this because I have faith. I have faith that this is a freedom loving nation, freedom beats in the heart of every American. And I know the American people are going to choose freedom again and reject the radical left and Joe Biden and the pathway to socialism and decline. I know we’ll rise to the occasion. We’ll not only re-elect this President, but we’ll elect and re-elect principled conservatives at every level.\nMike Pence: (42:54)\nAnd I know you’re going to step forward and do your part. I want to thank you in advance for all that you’re going to do in these 83 days. And if you’re of a mind, I’d asked you to do one more thing. In every day that follows between now and when the polls close here in Arizona. As you’re inclined to bow the head and bend the knee, I encourage you to do that to.\nSpeaker 2: (43:24)\nWe will.\nMike Pence: (43:32)\nThe sweetest words that we ever hear as we travel around this country when people say, “I’m praying for you.” I’ve heard it today here in Arizona. And I hear it everywhere I go. So does the President, and I want to tell you, we feel those prayers. Keep it up, it matters. But on this one, I am not so much asking you to pray for a candidacy or pray for a cause. I just encourage you to pray for America. Pray for all of the American people. The good book tells us that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, he’ll do like he’s always done in much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land. This one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. It’ll make a difference, for our nation and our future. And as you pray, pray with confidence. We’re also told that where the spirit of the Lord is there’s freedom. And that means when we make freedom our cause, when we stand for freedom, when we defend freedom, when we live out freedom every day. We make his work on this earth our own, and that means freedom always wins.\nMike Pence: (45:18)\nSo thank you for coming out to this extraordinary day and to all the Latter-Day Saints for Trump I say, thank you for your support. And I leave here today with confidence that with your continued support and prayers, with these great conservatives re-elected to the House and Senate, and with four more years of President Donald Trump in the white house, we’re going to make America more prosperous than ever before. We’re going to make America safer than ever before. We’re going to heal our land and we’re going to make America great again. Again. Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless Arizona and God bless America.\nMike Pence: (46:09)\n(singing).', 'Vice President Mike Pence: (00:00)\nWell, hello, Arizona. To officer Justin Harris, to all the incredible men and women of the Arizona Police Association and all of their supporters, and especially their families, the governor Ducey, senator McSally, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans, it is great to be back in the Grand Canyon state with cops, for Trump. I appreciate you all coming out today. I’m very, very grateful and honored to receive that endorsement, but I got to be honest with you, I’m here for one reason and one reason only. And that is that Arizona and America need four more years of president Donald Trump in the White House. It really is great to be here with so many great friends and so many great friends of law enforcement. It’s also a real privilege for me to be here with a man I actually knew before he had the job he currently holds here in Arizona. He’s literally emerged as one of the best governors in America. He’s seen this economy grow. He’s seen your schools improve and he’s led this great state through trying times over the last many months, would you join me in thanking governor Doug Ducey for his leadership and his on wavering support of law enforcement across Arizona.\nVice President Mike Pence: (02:21)\nThank you, governor. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to begin by bringing greetings from another friend of mine. When I told him last night that I was headed to the Grand Canyon state, to be honest with you, I thought he sounded just a little bit jealous. But let me bring greetings and gratitude for today’s endorsement from a man who has been a champion for law and order every day of this administration, I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America, president Donald Trump. And on the president’s behalf, I really couldn’t be more proud to accept the Arizona Police Associations endorsement for four more years for this president in the White House. For the first day of this administration, president Trump has been keeping the promises that he made to the people of Arizona. We rebuild our military, we restore the arsenal of democracy and as the proud father of a United States Marine stationed right here in Arizona, I couldn’t be more proud that we’re finally given our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guard, the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation.\nVice President Mike Pence: (03:48)\nI mean, this president has actually signed the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And none of that would have been possible without the strong and principled support of an American who served this country for more than a quarter of a century in the United States Air Force. She made history there as the first female fighter pilot ever to fly in combat for her support for our troops, for her support for our national security, for her support for law enforcement here at home, we need to send Senator Martha McSally back to Washington, D.C. and I’m honored that she’s with us today. Thank you Martha.\nVice President Mike Pence: (04:39)\nSo we’ve rebuild our military. And before this pandemic struck under this president’s leadership, we revive the American economy after the slowest recovery, since the Great Depression. Under president Trump’s leadership, businesses large and small created more than 7 million jobs all across this nation. And we literally poured a foundation in this economy on which the economy of Arizona and America are already coming back. We also supported the rule of law and the right to life, and this president’s appointed more conservatives to our federal courts than any president in American history. So we’ve stood for the rule of law and we’ve stood without apology for the men and women who serve in the uniform of law enforcement at every level. With this president, this administration, that Senator, and that governor we’ll always back the blue\nVice President Mike Pence: (05:48)\nAnd it’s in support of our allies in leadership across Arizona that’s helped to make the difference and we’ll have even more support after you reelect this president for four more years. We also need Arizona to send Tiffany Shedd and Brandon Martin to a new Republican majority in the United States, Congress. Tiffany and Brandon stand up and take a bow, thanks for stepping forward. So for all he’s done, and for all we have yet to do, we need four more years of president Donald Trump in the White House. The president spoke for almost every American, not long ago when he said, and I quote, “The vast majority of police officers in this country are selfless and courageous public servants.” And so you are. I heard a story on Air Force Two on the way here about just one such officer. It was a stabbing that happened here in Tucson, and the officer arrived on the scene and the victim pointed out the suspect.\nVice President Mike Pence: (07:08)\nI heard the officer chased after the suspect, caught him as he was climbing a fence. Then the suspect turned, shot him and escape. The officer was wounded in the leg, but he kept his composure. He radioed in a description of the suspect and in just two days, law enforcement here in Tucson, tracked that suspect down and brought him to justice. And the officer went back to work as soon as he could, where he served the people of Tucson for more than 15 years would y’all join me in thanking officer Joby Dickinson for his courageous service that day and every day before in sense. Thank you, Joby. Great job.\nVice President Mike Pence: (08:07)\nI also heard that we’re joined by another officer not long ago, was dispatched to a reported home invasion. The victim was literally tied up and helpless. The officer spotted the suspect’s vehicle drove after them. The suspects fired I’m told more than a hundred rounds over more than 10 miles of a chase. And at one point, the officer’s vehicle was disabled from the gunfire and another police officer picked him up and they kept after it. They kept going until they caught the suspects, arrested him and brought them to justice too. Would you join me in thanking Tucson’s own officer Troy Wallan, where are you Troy? Take a bow. What a great police officer. [inaudible 00:09:00] never quit.\nVice President Mike Pence: (09:01)\nNever quit. Great job. Heroes like Officer [Dickinson 00:09:10] and Officer [Wallen 00:09:11] are why the overwhelming majority of the American people, back the Blue. We back you every day. When others run away from danger, police officers run straight into harm’s way. You count our lives as more important than your own. Put your lives on the line to protect someone that, in most cases, you never even met. And nowhere has that been truer or more poignant than over the last five months, here in Arizona and all across America. Our hearts and our prayers are with the more than 160000 Americans who have lost loved ones in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. And as we continue to marshal a whole of America response, as the governor often says, we all have a role to play, to do our part, to slow the spread, to protect the vulnerable and to save lives. And the people of Arizona are doing just that.\nVice President Mike Pence: (10:20)\nLike last week, the Governor was in Washington to brief the President on the progress that you’ve made. We’re pleased to learn the positivity rates have dropped from 21% down to 12%, new cases have been steadily dropping for a month. That’s a tribute to your governor. It’s a tribute to the people of Arizona. We have a ways to go. All of us will continue to do our part. We’ll continue to slow the spread, flatten the curve, and save lives. But as I said, in these challenging times, none have done more to save American lives than our heroic healthcare workers, first responders, and the men and women of law enforcement, here in Arizona and across the country. It’s true.\nVice President Mike Pence: (11:12)\nYou step into harm’s way, often, without regard to your personal safety. You rendered assistance. You got people of the communities, all across this state, to the care that any one of us would want a family member to have. You stood in the gap in the midst of a pandemic. And for that, you have the thanks from the admiration of the American people. That’s why it’s amazing to think that in the wake of all that heroism, even the heroism of these recent days, that some of the leading politicians in the Democratic Party today, liken law enforcement officers to stormtroopers. Joe Biden said, not long ago, that well-armed police become in his words, the enemy when confronting lawlessness in our streets. Well, I want to assure you that your President, your Vice President and the overwhelming majority of the American people know that the men and women of law enforcement are the best people in this country. Law enforcement isn’t the problem. Law enforcement is the solution. That’s why President Trump and our entire administration back to blue, just like everybody gathered here today. And we’re going to stand with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line every single day. You are literally what separates order from chaos. Security is the foundation of our prosperity. So it’s been you, who’ve worn the uniform, who strapped on a sidearm, and kissed your families goodbye in the morning and walked down into that squad car or to walk that beat. It’s you who’ve made the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world possible. You make it possible for this nation to thrive and to prosper. And in these challenging times, to recover, and for every American to be able to live in the peace and security that every citizen in this nation, so richly deserves. So my fellow Americans, we are passing through a time of testing. But I’m here today because we will soon come to a time for choosing, and the choice in this election has never been clearer. And the stakes have never been higher.\nVice President Mike Pence: (13:50)\nIt really is a choice between freedom and opportunity versus socialism and decline. Joe Biden and the radical left offer a path starkly different from the path that President Trump set our nation on three-and-a-half years ago. Where we’ve cut taxes across the board for working families, businesses, and family farms and ranchers, Joe Biden would actually raise taxes by $4 trillion in the midst of a global pandemic. Where President Trump has cut more federal red tape than any president in American history, Joe Biden plans to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape, stifling American jobs. And Joe Biden even has a $2 trillion plan to abolish fossil fuels. But we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to stand for less taxes, less regulation, more American energy. That sounds like an Arizona agenda to me.\nVice President Mike Pence: (15:13)\nAnd it’s just been about jobs, it’s been about values. President Trump, I’m proud to say, has not only stood for the rule of law, but he stood for the sanctity of human life, and Joe Biden… Where Joe Biden abandoned his historic opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion, he now supports using taxpayer dollars to fund abortion in this country. And he’s calling for historic increases to Planned Parenthood. And maybe worst of all, as we gather today at Cops for Trump, here in Arizona, Joe Biden believes that America in his words is quote “systemically racist.” And that law enforcement has, again I quote, “an implicit bias against minorities.” Where President Trump has supported the men and women of law enforcement every day, Joe Biden and the radical left say that we have to choose between supporting our police or supporting all the families of our communities. But I think the people of Arizona, no different, the American people know we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors. We can do both. We have done both and we’re going to keep doing both for four more years.\nVice President Mike Pence: (16:42)\nThe truth is as we stand here today, as [Justin 00:17:04] just said, in cities across the country, there are people who think they have to make that choice and are making the wrong choice. In cities across the country, you have elected officials that are stepping away from support for law enforcement, believing that they have to choose between supporting the men and women who protect the community and supporting families in the community. I just heard that Minneapolis has already begun dismantling their police department. In New York city, Mayor de Blasio actually cut the NYPD budget by a billion dollars. And on Monday of this week, the Seattle City Council actually approved millions of dollars in budget cuts to the police department, after watching rioters and anarchists take over part of their city for more than three weeks.\nVice President Mike Pence: (18:03)\n… takeover part of their city for more than three weeks. And, when Joe Biden was asked if he would support cutting funding to law enforcement, he replied, yes, absolutely. Amid efforts to defund police across this country, cities are struggling with rising crime rates. History teaches that weakness arouses evil. And, as we see major city stepping away from support for law enforcement, buying into the agenda of the radical left, we’re also seeing crime rise in those very same cities across the nation. Just this past weekend alone, we had 40 people shot in Chicago. New York City reached its one thousandth victim and has had more shootings this year than in all of the last year already. In fact, in our nation’s Capitol, 21, people were shot at a block party just a few days ago. In city after city, we see the crime rate rising, the murder rate rising in cities that are stepping away from support for law enforcement. And, for the sake of those families, in every major city in this land, men and women of Arizona, this has got to stop.\nVice President Mike Pence: (19:38)\nWe must restore law and order to the streets of our communities for every American of every race, and creed, and color. And this we will do. We’re going to do it. Honestly, those heartbreaking numbers are just a preview of Joe Biden’s agenda. The truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America. After years of plummeting crime rates under President Trump, Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence on the streets of America cities. When Democrats call for defunding the police, remember what’s at stake, law and order, safety, and the peace of mind that our families and our children have every right to expect in the greatest nation on earth.\nVice President Mike Pence: (20:51)\nSo, as they make their case on the airwaves of the nation next week, I want you to hear this directly from me, on behalf of the president of the United States and our entire administration, we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. We’re going to back the blue. We’re going to back the blue with more resources and more support. We’re going to back the blue by making resources available to law enforcement agencies all across this country to improve public safety, enhance training and accountability. We’re going to continue to expand funding like the funding that we provided for 4,000 new police officers through the COPS Program. And, as the president announced a month ago, by making resources available to departments across the country. We’re just going to help law enforcement officers get better trained to do their job in the most difficult circumstances.\nVice President Mike Pence: (22:13)\nAll of you gathered here know, especially those of you wearing a uniform, no one hates bad cops more than good cops. Now, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis. And justice will be served. But there’s also no excuse for rioting, and looting, and the arson that took place in the days that followed. Burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech. Throwing bottles and rocks at police officers here in Tucson isn’t peaceful protests. And those who do such things are not peaceful protesters. They’re criminals. And they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nVice President Mike Pence: (23:16)\nWhile Joe Biden and the Democratic party continue to coddle the radical left, from our nation’s capital, to Portland, to cities across the country, President Trump is taking action to restore law and order. Just last month at the White House, the president announced what we call Operation Legend. It’s a surge of federal law enforcement officers into our hardest hit cities, cities that are experiencing enormous surges in violence and crime due to misgovernance and also due to the drive for defunding by the radical left. The operation is actually named after a little boy, a four year old African American boy named Legend Taliferro.\nVice President Mike Pence: (24:12)\nLast month, little Legend was gunned down while sleeping in his home in Kansas city, Missouri. That four year old boy had spent the night before building a pillow fort with his dad. And, when he was shot, he was sleeping in the fort he and his dad had made. When police arrived on the scene, they rushed him to the hospital, but it was too late. Little Legend died of his injuries.\nVice President Mike Pence: (24:57)\nWith the launch of Operation Legend, I promise you little Legend will not have died in vain. The operation in his name is, as we speak big, bringing peace and security to cities all across the country. When his mom heard about the operation, and the surge of forces, and even heard of some of the criticism, his mom said, “If you are against that, maybe you need to reevaluate.” And she was right.\nVice President Mike Pence: (25:40)\nBut it’s stories like Legend that break the heart of the American people. But I also know that it’s the little ones like Legend, and like his family, the community in which he lived that drew those of you who wear the uniform of law enforcement into service. Because law enforcement isn’t an occupation so much as it’s a calling. I’ve never talked to a police officer that didn’t speak of it just that way. It’s a selfless calling to count others as more important than yourself. It’s a calling to protect the vulnerable, to stay on the watch. And it’s a calling that is born more of the heart than of the mind. And every police officer I’ve ever spoken to about why they serve made it clear, you serve because you love this country. You love your city.\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:02)\n… country. You love your city. You love this state. And I want you to know Arizona and America Love you right back.\nVice President Mike Pence: (27:20)\nAs President Trump said, we may come from different backgrounds, but we’re united in our desire to ensure peace and the dignity of all Americans and you in law enforcement are the instrument of securing that for every American, every background, every walk of life. So for all you do on behalf of a grateful nation, I promise you: we’ll always have your back. This President, this Vice President, this administration will always back the blue. Because we’re all grateful. We’re grateful for what you do. You know what, it seems like sometimes I reflect on the fact that, all of my heroes wear uniforms and not on the Gridiron and not on the hard court, but wear the uniform of law enforcement. Wear the uniform of our armed forces. When I was a little boy, we used to drive up to Chicago to my grandmother’s house. And I got to see my uncle dress out every day we were there. When he’d come walking out of his bedroom, wearing that Chicago Police Department uniform, that shiny leather belt, sidearm, badge on his chest, made me proud.\nVice President Mike Pence: (29:04)\nSo I also want to just say we’re grateful each and every one of you that wear the uniform. But would you tell your families we’re just as grateful for them because I’ll never know what it is to wear that uniform, but I know what it is to be a member of a family that does. And we are grateful for your families, for the love and support they give you as you serve.\nVice President Mike Pence: (29:41)\nSo on behalf of your President, all the grateful American people, I’m here to say thanks. I know you have the gratitude and respect of this nation. You see it when you’re walking a beat, when you stop in and get a cup of coffee, when you bump people in the drug store, at the grocery store, at church, or synagogue, or your place of worship. People show you that respect.\nVice President Mike Pence: (30:10)\nI know you feel it every day, despite what happens in the public debate or on the airwaves of television. I know here on the streets of Tucson, all across Arizona, you feel that gratitude, but I also hope you feel one other thing. I hope as you go out the door in the morning, those of you that wear the uniform, I hope you know that I believe with all my heart that you are carried into service every day by the prayers of millions of people who pray for you, who pray for your safety, and pray for your service every single day.\nVice President Mike Pence: (30:59)\nIt’s true. This is a nation of faith. I hear people speak about it every day, everywhere I go and I don’t ever want you to doubt that as you put on that uniform, you do not go alone. You go with the confidence of your President, the confidence of your Governor, confidence of the people that you serve. And I believe you go with the grace of God. The men and women of law enforcement bear a great responsibility, it has always been true. The Bible reminds us that there’s no authority except that which God has established and each one of you who protect and serve, are as the good book says servants for good, who do not bear the sword in vain.\nVice President Mike Pence: (31:48)\nPeople in this country understand that timeless truth, they understand the risks that you take and are grateful for what you do. So on their behalf and on our behalf, thank you for your service and thank you all for coming out today. It’s wonderful to be back in Arizona. Thank you for coming out to support President Trump. Thank you for coming out to support Senator Martha McSally. And I just know seeing the enthusiasm in this room, if all of us do all we need to do between now and election day here in Arizona and across America, we’re going to win a great victory for the people of this country. We’re going to reelect that Senator to a Republican majority. We’re going to elect a new Republican majority in the house of representatives with Tiffany Shed and Brandon Martin. And with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, we’ll see our way through these challenging times. We’ll make Arizona more prosperous than ever before. We’ll make Arizona safer than ever before. And to borrow a phrase, we’ll make America great again, again.\nVice President Mike Pence: (33:07)\nThank you all very much. God bless the men and women of law enforcement and God bless America.', 'Arturo Vargas: (00:00)\n… the issues raised in our plenary sessions yesterday. Please visit our service project site and participate in the fundraising challenge to support the Farmworkers’ COVID-19 Pandemic Relief Fund and the Las Vegas based nonprofit food bank, Three Square. We couldn’t be in Las Vegas in person this year, yet we can still support our community there. Please also consider making a direct contribution to these causes. For those of you who have shared with us the memory of loved ones who you have lost a COVID-19 on our remembrance and healing wall, we share in your grief and extend our deepest sympathy. Please visit the site on the conference experience to share your thoughts. We will get through this together.\nArturo Vargas: (00:48)\nNow, I want to kick off this final portion of our NALEO 37th annual conference by introducing one of our presidential sponsors and hosts of today’s forum, Wells Fargo, represented by Mr. William M. Daley, vice chairman of public affairs at Wells Fargo and company. Wells Fargo has been a loyal supporter of the work we do at NALEO. With Wells Fargo’s support, we are able to provide our members with year-round networking opportunities, vital and cutting edge policy and discussions and other critical resources that help them in their work on the front lines of government. Wells Fargo also served as the chair of this year’s Edward R. Roybal Legacy Gala on March 11th. Now, that was the last time we were able to hold an in-person event. It was then that Eric Hoplin, head of external relations, announced that Wells Fargo’s ATMs would feature a message encouraging participation in the 2020 census as a result of our work together.\nArturo Vargas: (01:52)\nNow as vice chairman of public affairs for Wells Fargo, Mr. Daley helps facilitate key relationships like ours. Prior to serving as President Obama’s chief of staff from 2010 to 2012, Mr. Daley worked in the private sector, and he also served as Secretary of Commerce in the Clinton Administration. It was then when he last joined us for NALEO 15th Annual Conference in 1998, as we were preparing for the 2000 census. So please join me in welcoming back to the NALEO Annual Conference, virtually a key partner, friend to our mission, our staff and our members. Please welcome the honorable William M. Daley, vice chairman of public affairs at Wells Fargo and Company. Welcome Mr. Daley.\nWilliam Daley: (02:40)\nThank you very much, Arturo. We are pleased at Wells Fargo to be back at NALEO once again, and being a sponsor and host of this most important forum. It’s great being back with friends and to have the opportunity to spend a minute or two to speak before we get to the really important things. I hope you and all the families of the people in on this call are staying healthy and are being careful. This is an unprecedented time in our nation and around the world. Communities, particularly diverse and underserved communities, are suffering mightily. There’s a lot of uncertainty about our future, and we’re not totally sure what the future holds for the pandemic. We must all work together to help the hardest hit recover.\nWilliam Daley: (03:28)\nAt Wells Fargo, we have already committed more than 175 million to address food insecurity, housing and other emergency needs during this COVID crisis. We are also donating all gross PPP fees, which are around $400 million, to help small businesses, particularly minority-owned businesses so they can survive and recover when things get better. At the same time, our country is facing a long overdue reckoning around racial equity, and the private sector must be part of this effort like no time before. Wells Fargo has made a number of important commitments on that front, including the creation of a new diversity leader whose position is about really trying to figure out what we do as a business in diverse communities and how we can provide better services, products, and be greater involved in those communities. And also, our senior leadership will have their compensation connected to the progress they meet in meeting our diversity goals.\nWilliam Daley: (04:37)\nOne of the most critical things to do, as Arturo mentioned, is to get an accurate census count. When I was Secretary of Commerce in 2000, as Arturo said, I oversaw the census, which is one of the most important traditions in our democracy. I’m proud to be involved again at Wells Fargo, for we are formerly encouraging our employees and those in our communities to do their civic duty by being counted. We’re running ads on over 13,000 ATMs across the country and promoting the census through social media and other media channels. We have also been urging our employees to register and make plans to vote early if they’re able to, during this most important election year. Like you, we do believe that every vote matters. Speaking of elections, I’m eager to hear from my friend, vice president, Joe Biden, so I will wrap it up by saying, we are extremely proud at Wells Fargo to not only be involved with NALEO, but to be involved with so many members in NALEO at the local level around the country. So again, Arturo, thank you for the opportunity to be involved, and it’s back to you and the vice president. Thank you very much.\nArturo Vargas: (05:58)\nThank you, Bill. We really appreciate your support and the support of Wells Fargo, and we look forward to working with you in the coming years to make sure that we’re able to do all that we can to fulfill our mission at the NALEO Educational Fund. Now I’m really excited to begin our presidential candidate forum. One of the main purposes of the NALEO Annual Conference is to bring together the nation’s top leaders and Latino policy makers together to engage in critical conversations about the future of our country. During presidential election years, like this one, we invite candidates running for their party’s nominations and those who become presumptive nominees. I am delighted to welcome back to the NALEO Annual Conference the honorable Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee for President of the United States. We also extended an invitation to President Donald Trump to join us.\nArturo Vargas: (06:58)\nMr. Vice President, we look forward to learning about your vision for the future of the nation and of the U.S. Latino community, and most critically, how you will address the challenges that we face. The strength of our democracy is being tested by the crises of COVID-19, misinformation, interference in our elections and the barriers to voting and to a fair and accurate 2020 census. The Latino community has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, suffering higher rates of infection and tragic deaths, and have been economically devastated. We look forward to hearing how Latinos will be equitably included in COVID-19 health and economic recovery efforts, and how would your administration address existing disparities.\nArturo Vargas: (07:49)\nWe continue to look for courageous leadership to finally create a fair and humane immigration system and comprehensive reform that modernizes our obsolete approach to this issue. Latinos look to our leaders with the expectation that those at the very top of government will spearhead a voting rights agenda that protects the right to vote for all Americans. These are just some of the issues that are important to Latinos. Indeed, every American issue is a Latino issue. Many of these issues have been addressed through this virtual NALEO 37th Annual Conference, so in the spirit of continuing this conversation, I am happy to welcome the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Vice President Joe Biden. Welcome.\nJoe Biden: (08:43)\nHello, NALEO. How are you? Good to see you again, Arturo. I want to say a special hi to my good friend, and he is my good friend, Secretary Daley. Billy, it’s been a long time, pal. Glad to see you looking so well. I look forward to seeing you pretty soon. I’m honored to be with you all today, and I want to start by thanking Arturo for this opportunity to share my vision for Latinos in our country. If I have the honor of being elected president, I want to thank you for your opening remarks, and I’m going to need you if I get elected. Not just getting elected, if I get elected.\nJoe Biden: (09:21)\nThroughout our decades and your decades, I think I go way back. I may have been at that 39 years ago when you started, decades leading NALEO Education Fund. We’ve seen a lot of ups and downs in the Latino community, but none more stark than the last three and a half years. Donald Trump and his administration have pursued an all out assault. That’s how I phrase it, assault on Latino communities, from the moment he came down that golden escalator saying he was going to go after those Mexicans rapists. Remember? That’s how he started his campaign. It started the moment he announced his presidency, fanning the flames of fear and racism against Latinos.\nJoe Biden: (10:02)\nThe flames of fear and racism against Latinos. It’s baked into every aspect of how he’s governed. And this week was an especially poignant reminder of the terrible consequence, allowing that kind of hate to grow, to grow unchecked. You know, I thought we could defeat hate, but and it only hides under the rocks. And when a president breathes oxygen in, it comes out roaring out.\nJoe Biden: (10:25)\nOn Monday, we marked the one year anniversary of the tragic mass shooting in El Paso, where a gunman explicitly sought to target Latinos and 23 beautiful lives were stolen from us and their families. I know what it’s like to lose a child. And I know what it was like to lose a wife. It is awful. It is starkly. I shouldn’t get started. You know, the stakes of Trump’s irresponsible policies of division and hate that he promotes is real. These are life and death decisions. Whether it’s repeated attacks on Dreamers or his campaign of terror against immigrant communities, whether it’s his neglect of the people of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, which is outrageous or his repeated failures to make sure essential workers have the personal protective equipment they need. Donald Trump has failed the Latino community time and time again.\nJoe Biden: (11:25)\nSo the question you ask Arturo, how are we going to make real a better life for Latinos? That’s the key question, and the future of our country literally depends on how we answer it. That’s how important it is. Because here’s the God’s honest truth, the future success that our country are going to depend on our ability to make sure Latinos have opportunities and the tools to succeed. Latino is among the fastest growing population in the United States. Already one quarter of our school children, one quarter of our school children are Latino. How in God’s name can we have a strong and thriving Republic if we don’t fully deal Latinos into every aspect of American life? These kids are not someone else’s kids, they’re our kids. The kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft.\nJoe Biden: (12:16)\nThat’s why earlier this week I released my Latino agenda. Things I’ve been working on all along and you know about, but I put them all in one place. It’s a comprehensive plan for not just how we’re going to undo all the harms that the Trump administration has inflicted, but how we’re going to really make sure Latinos are included in our plans to build back and build back better. That means investing in Latino’s economics mobility, because that’s the best basis of it all, economic mobility. Everything from making sure Latino small business owners can access capital to making it easy for Latino families to buy a home to build intergenerational wealth. How did every other middle class person do it when they came here? They were able to ultimately buy a home and build equity in the home and pass it on from generation to generation.\nJoe Biden: (13:10)\nOne of the four planks of my Build Back Better plan is about addressing racial inequities across the entire economy. It’s about breaking the cycle where in good times, Latino communities still lag behind. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest as you referenced, Arturo. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back and only get back to where they were at the beginning, which wasn’t a good place to begin with. We’re going to use every tool at our disposal to take on these inequities.\nJoe Biden: (13:39)\nMy Latino agenda also focused on any race based health disparities. Latinos were among the biggest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act with millions gaining insurance for the first time. The uninsured rate dropped from 32% to 19%, and my plan would bring it down to zero. That’s what an incredible win, it was a significant win for Latino community. But now in the midst of a pandemic, when almost 160,000 dead, those families lost part of their soul, part of their heart. Donald Trump is trying to strip people off their healthcare coverage in court in the middle of a pandemic. And Latinos are burying some of the heaviest burdens, go through the higher rates of infection and because Latinos disproportionately serve in caregiving roles on the frontline jobs and increase the risk of exposure and save other people. It’s unconscionable.\nJoe Biden: (14:39)\nI’m going to protect Obamacare and build on it with a public option, so every single person can have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare. When it comes to fighting this pandemic, we have to be crystal clear. Everyone gets free access to testing and treatment. And when it’s available, a vaccine, everyone gets it. We have to fight this virus without regard to immigrant status. That’s the only way we’re going to beat this thing. And it’s only humane thing to do.\nJoe Biden: (15:12)\nWe’re also going to expand access to high-quality education and take on the racial inequities in our education system. That starts early. We are making sure high-quality pre-K is available to every child, three and four years old. Because the studies show that increases exponentially the prospects of success through the entire 12 years. It goes all the way through making sure post high school education is affordable for Latino students, ensuring public colleges and universities are tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year, doubling Pell Grants, $12,000, increasing funding for Hispanic serving institutions.\nJoe Biden: (15:54)\nI started today by speaking about the tragedy in El Paso one year ago. We also know Latinos suffer every day from hate crimes and gun violence. It doesn’t always make national headlines. Under the Biden administration, we’re going to get weapons of war and high capacity magazines out of our communities. I’m going to take the fight directly to the NRA and hold gun manufacturers accountable for the damage they caused to Latino families. Finally, we’re going to restore our values as a nation of immigrants.\nJoe Biden: (16:27)\nTrump fails to understand the basic truth of immigrants. That they’re the incredible source of our nation’s strength and they always have been. All the way back to the 1860s, when my Irish ancestors jumped on coffin ships in the Irish sea, not knowing where they are going, not knowing whether they’re going to make it to the shore all the way to today. There’s the reason we’ve been able to constantly renew and remake ourselves because we’ve been able to cherry pick the best of every culture. It takes courage to leave and come here from every continent, from every background. That’s why we’re who we are.\nJoe Biden: (17:03)\nIf I’m elected president, we’re going to immediately end Trump’s assault on the dignity of immigrant communities. We’re going to restore our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers, and those fleeing violence and persecution. My Lord, we’ve never made asylum seekers stay, seek asylum outside the United States of America. We’re going to stop the inhumane practice of separating children from their parents and work to reunite families. Look at all the families that are not reunited. We’re going to stop detaining people and definitely invest instead on case management programs to help ensure migrants get the support they need while they’re navigating the asylum process. It’s going to cost a lot of money, but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than building a wall. We’re going to restore a sensible enforcement priorities and stop terrorizing Latino communities.\nJoe Biden: (17:59)\nThe idea is you wait outside the 10 o’clock mass to grab someone from church. The anxiety for the children, the anxiety is overwhelming. It’s going to have a profound impact on a generation. We’re going to protect Dreamers and their families, and every single agreement that the Trump administration signed to turn local law enforcement and immigration officials. On day one, I’m going to send Congress a bill for immigration reform. We’ll focus on keeping families together. It’s about families, including providing a clear roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented alien and undocumented immigrants. Stop treating them the way they’re being treated. We’re going to live in enriching our communities every single day.\nJoe Biden: (18:51)\nI know that’s a pretty big agenda, but this is a moment to get it done. The pandemic has lift the blinders off so many people in this country on who’s really essential to our economic strength. It’s not Wall Street bankers or CEOs. The middle class hardworking union members fighting for the rights of all workers, the folks in the Latino community who are busting their necks every day to keep the country running. And I believe, I really do believe we’re ready to close the respect gap, the dignity gap, the wage gap, the opportunity gap. So many Latino workers have suffered for so long.\nJoe Biden: (19:34)\nYou know my dad used to have an expression, he say, “Joey …” When he lost the job up in Scranton and we had to move down to Delaware and my dad never went to college. He was a graceful, good man. He used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about honor. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’” That’s what we’re going to do. Dignity, honor, treating people.\nJoe Biden: (20:03)\n… Do, dignity, honor, treating people with dignity. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, and the full diversity of the Latino communities. Now, when I mean full diversity, unlike the African-American community and many other communities, you’re from everywhere. They’re from Europe, from the tip of South America, all the way to our border in Mexico and in the Caribbean. And different backgrounds. Different ethnicities, but all Latinos. We’re going to get a chance to do that if we win in November. It means we need everyone to get out and vote. I can’t do this without your help.\nJoe Biden: (20:49)\nThe path to victory in November is contingent upon Latino voters, particularly in those battleground states. I’m committed to speaking directly to the concerns of the Latino community and to mobilizing Latino voters. I have a significant staff. We’re trying to advertise on Latino stations, on Spanish-speaking stations. We need every single voter to sign up and get engaged in our campaign. We need you to get out and vote with your family and your friends. And make sure that people know how to register and how to vote safely during the pandemic.\nJoe Biden: (21:27)\nWe need to provide voters with more options, not fewer. Need to expand the option for participation. No excuse absentee ballots, when you get an absentee ballot just because you need one and want one. Increased in-person early voting. Have enough poll workers who can sanitize the machines and make sure we can socially distance and wearing masks. A lot of taking away meaningful opportunities to go in-person on election day. Our campaign is putting together the largest voter protection effort in the United States’ history because we know that we have to. We’ve already seen the impact that the pandemic has had on voting rights and voting during the primaries. We know. We know that voter suppression was alive and well in America before the public health crisis.\nJoe Biden: (22:18)\nAnd make no mistake about it, as you pointed out, the Census is part of this, too. Everyone needs to be counted. Four former Census Bureau directors who have worked under nine presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, have called on the Senate and the administration to work to extend the deadline so we’d get an accurate count. Arturo, you mentioned the Voting Rights Act at the beginning. Well, today happens to be the 55th anniversary of its enactment. I worked like hell to strengthen and extend that Voting Act when I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Throughout my career, going back to 1975, back then, in 2013 though the Supreme Court came along and stripped the teeth out of the Voting Rights Act. It’s of the preclearance provision, they said was no longer necessary. I’m going to make sure it’s reinserted if the Congress doesn’t get it done in the remaining months of this Congress.\nJoe Biden: (23:18)\nJust last year, 29 states, 29 states introduced or carried over bills that tried to make it harder for people to vote. This blatantly Unamerican. Our democracy, one person, one vote. That’s the very heart of who we are. And if the Senate, Republican Senate, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, don’t take up the bill, newly renamed in honor of my friend John Lewis to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full power, I will make it a priority on day one that we do that if I’m elected president.\nJoe Biden: (23:59)\nSo, I guess what I really want to say is just thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. And thank you again, Arturo, and everyone at NALEO for the work you’ve been doing. You make the country stronger. You make us all better. That’s not hyperbole. You make us all better, and the country is better, stronger, more prosperous, more decent, more honorable if we, in fact, reach out and embrace the largest population of immigrants in the United States and include them across the board. It’s a source of amazing strength for us. What I said, “I think because this COVID crisis and unemployment crisis” I think the American people are seeing that now. Least I hope that’s the case. I’m going to need your help if I’m elected to get all this done.\nJoe Biden: (24:57)\nMay God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.\nArturo Vargas: (25:05)\nThank you, Mr. Vice President for your remarks and thank you for joining us at this virtual NALEO annual conference. We wish we could have met in person, but I hope that should you be successful in your quest for election that you will join us next year in person at the NALEO 38th annual conference. More than anything else, we look forward to both political parties, both campaigns, and both candidates to engage Latino voters across all 50 states, so that Latino voters understand what’s at stake in this election and they can make an informed ballot. We need both candidates to fight for the Latino vote.\nArturo Vargas: (25:52)\nSo, now we are at the final part of our time together in this virtual NALEO 37th annual conference, the conference wrap-up. Thank you all for joining us and for being a part of the NALEO familia during these extraordinary times. If this was your first time attending an NALEO event, I hope it was worthwhile, and that you’ll consider becoming an NALEO lifetime member.\nArturo Vargas: (26:18)\nI would like to thank another of our presidential sponsors, and the host of today’s conference wrap-up, Edison International. Their support has been invaluable in our ability to reach and serve our community and to reach our nation’s Latino elected and appointed officials. Edison’s track record of community engagement and giving back to build a better tomorrow is a part of their commitment to service, a promise that has realized their support of organizations like ours. So, please welcome Pedro Pizarro, president and chief executive officer of Edison International.\nPedro Pizarro: (26:56)\nHi, Pedro Pizarro here again from Edison International. Thank you for attending the conference. We look forward to welcoming you in Hollywood, California next year.\nArturo Vargas: (27:10)\nThank you, Pedro, and Edison International for all you do in support of our organization. You know, we have reiterated how Latino elected and appointed officials need on the front lines of government as our nation continues to endure this crisis. But just because we are dealing with the pandemic does not mean that all other issues important to our communities disappear. This is why good leadership requires new, innovative strategies and collaboration for tackling the public policy issues our communities face.\nArturo Vargas: (27:44)\nOur next guest is one of those Latino leaders. Serving as the mayor of one of the largest cities in the United States, please welcome my own mayor and member of the NALEO board of directors, Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti.\nEric Garcetti: (28:01)\nThank you, Arturo. It is always a pleasure to be with my NALEO family, and it’s my great honor to follow Vice President Biden, a dear friend who asked me to be one of his national co-chairs and find a running mate. Somebody who’s been committed to our communities for his entire public life. I also want to acknowledge Edison International for helping to make this conference possible. And my fellow NALEO board members who are a source of strength and light every day for me and for this country. I look forward to this conference every year because it’s an opportunity to see friends, familiar faces, and to plan our future. To feel the power and potential of our extraordinary coalition. And though we can’t be together physically this year, our connections are unwavering. Our coalition is as strong as ever, and our vision is clear, for a more just America, a place where everyone belongs and a nation that lives up to it’s promise. Just as it did for my family and for many of yours.\nEric Garcetti: (29:02)\nThe barriers to those goals are always tough to scale, and in this moment of crisis, they seem nearly insurmountable. As we face a virus that’s struck every community but hit us, Latino families and people of color, with a devastating force. A recession that’s shaken every sector, but delivered too many knockout punches to too many of our workers struggling to pay rent, and immigrants cut off from federal relief. A Census count that’s been politically compromised and cut short for every community, but leaves so much hanging in the balance for cities and states with large Latinx populations.\nEric Garcetti: (29:37)\nCOVID-19 has affected all of us, but has not affected all of us equally. In my City of Angels, we saw these challenges early and rose to meet them, bringing testing to all residents, regardless of immigration status. Quadrupling test sites in areas with Black and Latinx residents. And establishing the largest emergency rental program in the nation. We deployed unprecedented Census resources to reach neighborhoods usually-\nEric Garcetti: (30:03)\n… precedented census resources to reach neighborhoods usually undercounted. And we provided critical cash assistance to more than 100,000 of our neighbors on the brink of financial ruin, nearly 44% of whom were Latino and Latina. We did all of this work because it was right and it was smart and it was just. But let’s not mince words. There are clear reasons why Latinos have fewer resources to weather this storm, why we’re dying more, why we’re losing our jobs more than any other group, and it didn’t need to be this way. This is what happens when the administration rolls back worker protections. This is what happens when a government launches a full scale years long assault on immigrants and their families. Takes parents away from children, forces dreamers and their loved ones back into the shadows. This is what happens when leaders create a climate of fear and tell people to go back to places they’ve never lived.\nEric Garcetti: (30:59)\nWhen they seek to strip America of the very communities, culture, the legacy, the histories that have made us who we are. Well, our community knows what it’s like to struggle and to defy the odds. We’ve been here before and we know how to move forward. To write a new Capito, a chapter of ours, because our heritage is of ordinary people who have built coalition stronger than any unjust policy. Who’ve made changes that endured long after the abuses faded away. A spirit that lifted up farm workers who rose up alongside Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, who marched and organized and fought until the rights achieved in the fields of Delano rang out across this nation. That mission that motivated leaders throughout California to stand up against Prop 187 and that awakened a new coalition that permanently changed the face of politics in my state and that is changing in all of yours as well.\nEric Garcetti: (31:54)\nThat tradition is what America’s first Chicano poet laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera, meant when he wrote [foreign language 00:02:02], freedom comes from deep inside. And that history and deep well of experiences endured, obstacles overcomed, that is our strength. What gives us confidence that even in this difficult hour, we will summon persistence and perseverance and passion to keep pushing forward. I wish that we were all gathered in one place to do that hard work face-to-face. And I think in a year’s time, I’m hopeful that we will be again. And I’m thrilled to announce that the NALEO Conference will be here in the City of Angeles in 2021.\nEric Garcetti: (32:40)\nBut whether we’re socially distanced or physically together, we can and we will unlock the power of our partnership. And by this time next year, I know we will look back and say, this was the year our communities took to the polls in record numbers to send an unmistakable message to Washington. That this was the year our voices carried from city halls and state capitals to the chambers of Congress and the corridors of Le Casablanca. And this was the year we didn’t just respond to an unprecedented crisis, but we reimagined what this country can be and reaffirmed our promise to all of our people.\nEric Garcetti: (33:19)\nMy friends, [foreign language 00:03:20]. Let’s get to work now. And with that, it is my deepest honor to introduce a dear friend and colleague, the leader of my city’s city council, the first Latina City Council president in the history of our city, [foreign language 00:03:36] Nury Martinez.\nNury Martinez: (33:42)\nHello everyone, I’m LA Council President, Nury Martinez. The City of Los Angeles cannot wait to see you at the NALEO Conference in Los Angeles in 2021. As we wrap up this year’s virtual conference, I want to offer a few words of hope, optimism, and a little reminder about who we are as Latinos in what are clearly dark times. Our Latinx community is under attacked on all fronts, from a president who has attacked us from day one and who continues to attack us. And COVID-19 is attacking our community, killing Latinos at a higher rate than any other community, because so many of our people do not have the luxury to work from home.\nNury Martinez: (34:22)\nSo what are we to do about this? We fight. That’s what Cesar Chavez taught us and that’s what John Lewis taught us and that’s what Dolores Huerta teaches us, fight and make good trouble. We need to fight to elect a president who supports our community and our fundamental rights as Latinos to live, grow, and prosper in this country. As a daughter of the working poor, Mexican immigrant from the city Zacatecas, growing up, little girls who look like me and talk like me were not supposed to end up in positions like this. And while I am honored to be the first Latina City Council president in 170 years in the city’s history, I must not be the last. There is no governmental body that women should not have a chance to lead anywhere in the United States, especially women of color. So I call on all of you, especially Latino men, to empower and uplift strong Latinas to run for office and to the positions of power that we so richly deserve. So let’s continue to make good trouble my friends.\nArturo Vargas: (35:32)\nThank you, Mayor Garcetti and Council President, Martinez. And I can’t tell you how much I wish that we will be able to gather everyone in-person next year here in the City of Angeles. So now our last guest is part of a very important relationship to our organization. The ability to collaborate, disseminate, and educate the public alongside trusted media partners is a critical part of the work that we do. Our relationship with Comcast NBCUniversal Telemundo has been a part of the foundation with which our organization has been able to reach our community and to do the work we set out to accomplish.\nArturo Vargas: (36:12)\nThat is why we would like to thank Comcast NBCUniversal Telemundo for their support as our national media sponsor for this year’s Virtual NALEO 37th Annual Conference. Your support for our organization has proven to be instrumental in accomplishing our mission. Our partnership with Telemundo has created a driving force of trustworthy and useful information, thoughtfully disseminated to consumers, the Spanish language media. From citizenship days to national census days to the various campaign efforts in which we have joined together, Telemundo has been an integral part of what has become an essential lasting partnership. That is why we see Comcast NBCUniversal Telemundo as an unparalleled partner and an ally to our organization. Please welcome Christina Kolbjornsen, Telemundo Senior Vice President of Corporate and External Affairs.\nChristina Kolbjornsen: (37:13)\nThank you Arturo. Once again, we are so proud to be your partner doing NALEO’s first virtual conference. The conference focused on many of the same important issues that NBCUniversal Telemundo continues to report on such as the COVID-19 pandemic, census, and of course, the 2020 elections. I am very proud to announce that Telemundo will join NALEO Education Fund on Wednesday, August 19th, for NALEO’s Convention Briefing series. It will be the first time ever in the organization’s history that they will hold both an English and all Spanish discussion with renowned political experts and strategists during the two political conventions.\nChristina Kolbjornsen: (37:58)\nWith more than 14. 6 million Latino voters expected to cast ballots this November, that Latino community is poised to play a decisive role in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election and other key races throughout the nation. The convention briefings will focus on the growth of the Latino electorate nationwide and in key battleground states, the success of Latino candidates and the various issues that are likely to affect Latino turnout this year. We are grateful for our shared mission and look forward to being back together in Los Angeles next year.\nArturo Vargas: (38:45)\nThanks Christina. And once again, thank you Telemundo for your support. And we look forward to the partnership with our Convention Briefings. Now, that is another NALEO tradition that we began in the 2000 presidentials cycle. Every four years, we bring to the national conventions, a conversation-']
