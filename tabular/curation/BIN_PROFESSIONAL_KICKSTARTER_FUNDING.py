Dataset Name: kick_starter_funding
====
Examples: 86502

URL: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&id=46668

Description: Predict whether a proposed Kickstarter project will achieve funding goal based on text features
    like its title, description, numeric features like the amount of money requested, date posted, and
    categorical features like the country, currency, etc. This dataset represents a complex task where
    models must consider interactions between modalities to address a core question of Kickstarter's
    business: https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/funding-successful-projects

    We applied the next preprocessing for uploading to OpenML to properly quoted ARFF format: 
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: f'"{x}"' if isinstance(x, str) else x)
  
 Dataset found from the paper: Benchmarking multimodal automl for tabular data with text fields. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02705.
