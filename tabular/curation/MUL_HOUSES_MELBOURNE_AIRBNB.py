Description: Predict the price label of AirBnb listings (in Melbourne, Australia) based on information from the listing page including
    various text descriptions and many numeric features
    (e.g. host's response-rate, number of bed/bath-rooms) and categorical features (e.g. property
    type, superhost or not). Representing a complex classification task with many features from
    each modality, the original version of this dataset was released via the InsideAirbnb initiative:
    https://www.kaggle.com/tylerx/melbourne-airbnb-open-data

    We applied the next preprocessing for uploading to OpenML: 
    dataset.map(lambda x: f'"{x}"' if isinstance(x, str) else x)
