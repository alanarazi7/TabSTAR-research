Description (string, 38932 distinct): ["The room was kind of clean but had a VERY strong smell of dogs. Generally below average but ok for a overnight stay if you're not too fussy. Would consider staying again if the price was right. Breakfast was free and just about better than nothing.", 'Hadnt been to New York for about -- years so being nervous about returning to the city after all that time, I decided to stick with a chain I knew, have stayed at the chain in Cannes France on many occasions, which is very impressive. Forgotten how expensive hotels in NYC could be, --- without tax for a queen room. On arrival very impressed, Large lobby, plenty of places to sit  unwind but was disappointed with the first room given, no ---. Air conditioning was outside window so couldnt sleep  I just didnt feel that the room was worth the money. Asked to be moved, no problem, upgraded to a king bed, I think but more on that later,  the room was simply in a different class. Beautiful bed and bathroom. No view was an initial disappointment but after along day it was nice to be able to shut the world out as the room was just so quite it was difficult to remember you were in NYC. I would have given the hotel - stars for the original room at the rate paid, a beautiful hotel lobby cannot compensate for an average room causing lack of sleep but after the upgrade I think - stars is appropriate. Overall very clean, hotel about - years old, excellent location  would highly recommended. Emailed them -x about the type of room given in anticipation for a future stay but after - weeks still no response.', "I don't know why the other travel websites list this as a four-star hotel. The rooms may be kitschy-trendy, but cleanliness is questionable when your bed is on a low carpeted platform practically on the floor, there is an open food package in the wet bar, and the bottle of shower gel appeared to have been used. I booked my room through Hotwire expecting a four-star hotel; understandably, that is always a gamble, but this was very disappointing.\nTook a while to figure out that the valet parking was at the rear of the building, since they share a driveway with an independent parking lot next door. Valet parking is --. If you don't need in-and-out parking privileges and plan to be out by --AM the next day, it's only -- flat rate to self park in the underground garage (I believe this is the same garage where the cars are valet parked)", 'The staff was wonderful and the rooms beautiful. Lovely accomodations', "One of the nicest Marriotts I've ever stayed at, and I've been to a few dozen. Everything seemed pretty new. The room was clean, fresh, and very pleasant. The bed was standard Marriott plushness. The TV worked fine (although it was a standard flat-screen CRT, not an LCD). The bathroom was well-stocked and water pressure was pretty good on the --th floor.\nTwo caveats: One, there's no mini-fridge in the room. This was kind of annoying since we had a few of our own bottles of water and it was like -- degrees out that weekend. And two, hallway noise seemed a little louder than usual for a Marriott. We could hear quite a bit of activity whenever people would walk back and forth.\nThe front desk staff were very nice (Kirby was pretty cool). The only issue was that when we arrived at -pm, there was only one front desk clerk and like - or - people backed up in line. We waited for about five minutes but then - additional front desk staff showed up and we got checked in quickly. But where were those - staffers for the first five minutes?\nThe location, also, is excellent. You can actually SEE the infield at Petco from the rooftop bar. But be aware that the streets will get a little crowded if you visit during a home game. And the Gaslamp Quarter is right around the corner with a TON of bars and restaurants.\nIf we ever returned to the area, I'd probably stay at the Marriott again.", "My wife and I arrived Friday evening to a large party crowd in the lobby and at the bar, which had a live band playing. The band was rockin' but we were pretty tired after a days worth of layovers. The bros running around the lobby were not sober by any means and did not appear to be upstanding citizens, so we were not at ease during the check-in process. I guess if your not with them, you really don't want to play with them. Normally, I'd be up for shenanigans, but we were tired. If the swank, party city scene is yours, this would be a viable choice. The hotel is located within walking distance to a wine tasting bar-restaurant and a brewhouse with hundred's of fresh brews from around the world to choose from. We woke up every morning to some activity blasting in the city center (yoga and spinning classes). The rooms were modern and clean. Walk-in shower that's legit, no toilet-sink-shower privacy. The lights were a little dazed and confusing and almost felt prison-like. Overall, not a bad place for those seeking great restaurants, activities, and a Vegas scene minus the gambling. It really is in the city center.", 'This was the fourth time I stayed in this hotel since ----, twice with family, twice alone on business. I love the location - if you stay uptown central park south is great location, literally across from the park and the ice rink. Breakfast is perfect, although pricey - you pay -- for a buffet plus tip. The bar and restaurant is also nice for a hotel. But nothing beats the location. Just walking distance from the MoMA, Colombus circle, Rockefeler ctr, lincoln centre, the shops of -th ave and a little longer walk to the natural history museum on central park west. Good restaurants in the neighbourhod. And FaO Schwarz for those with kids. As most New York hotels, the lobby is magnificent as most common spaces but rooms are less attractive. Bathrooms feel old and a bit offputting and rooms are small. Even though you are really on central park, for --- or more you are bound to get a room looking over --th or airconditioning system. Overall I like the place for its unbeatable location if you choose to stay in uptown but the rooms can disappoint and expect to pay dearly for the experience.', 'I have been more times in Los Angeles, always sleeping in sunset str, or in nice - stars, this time was only - meetings the reason to go to LA, and my wife decide to take this one, nice reports and really good price.\nI can only recoment it, really nice peiple are managing it, rooms are really ok, you have good internet, nicetv, nice rooms, and really you a coming in one very nice family.\nThe one who manage it, are again, very nice people.\nNext time we will go there.\nHo i forgot, the main reason, you are there in the mitle from LA, behind jewlery, faschion, hollywood, beaches, really sensational location.\nThanks was nice in your house.\nYours\nJoan valls', "I have stayed in this hotel several times in the past - years. I have never had an awful experience. Some of the queen bed rooms are small. This trip I stayed in a room with two double beds for the first time. The room was larger as was the bathroom. The drawback was we were right over the CTA bus stop outside. However, when we put the ventailing system on fan and created a somewhat noisy white noise we were fine. The breakfast had actually improved since I had last stayed (about - years ago), the offerings were OK nothing special. There are some good breakfast places to eat nearby if you don't care for what they offer. All in all not a bad place to stay if you want to be in the Lincoln Park area.", "My girlfriend and I planned a trip months ago to visit Seattle May -- - --th. We stayed at the Westin downtown and were on the --th floor.. The room was wonderful and comfy with great beds but minimal bath towels. The heavenly shower was nice. There was an in room service bar from which you could purchase drinks-snacks. We didn't do this because it's pretty much just a lame expense. Local calls were -.-- each, so we made NONE (used our cell phones). The room rate was on the high side, and there are no smoking rooms there. They are all about the spa services and being 'green'. The in-room literature is a little lackluster. No nice pictures; not vibrant at all. They do offer a - or --- pt incentive kickback if you don't use housekeeping and let them know by -:-- a.m. for the previous day. However, when housekeeping DID come in once over our - days, they did not replace our soap, shampoos or ice bucket bag. There are no liners in the trash cans. I think that is yukky, especially for bathroom trash.\nThe valet parking charge of ---per day was super expensive in my book, but there really is no getting around heavy parking fees downtown. The valet staff was super on point, friendly and fast! They gave excellent directions and earned alot of tip . The front desk staff was uber professional but sometimes this was backed up.-slow paced. The restaurant was very nice and the food was average, with medium-high prices for lunch. My friend had the fish and chips which was sort of what you would classify as a 'small plate' for --. Service was professional and prompt.\nThe coffee area in the lobby is sort of a fustercluck and ill-arranged. We got an expensive cup of coffee and tripped around everyone else who was waiting, deciding, ordering, paying, getting sugar, helping themselves to refills (?) all in the same - ft spot. Uninviting.\nThere is alot of homeless and panhandling going on even around this hotel. Beware of people asking for money; watch your bags and be alert for strung out individuals. We saw them every day.\nI liked the in-room safe. There was ONE robe (?), a sharp carpet tack sticking out in front of the bath, and oh - pet peeve - and a determining factor of whether I re-visit a hotel or not: The A-C only went down to register --. You may think this is cool enough, but it was NOT. It wasn't -- in the room, and I do not want anyone to determine for me what A-C temp is cool enough. I will decide, especially when I pay upward of --- per night. Green or not, comfort is key and when promising luxury, do not decide which temperature makes me comfortable. I prefer cool accommodations and I did not find this at the Westin. It was too hot for both of us at night. If your hotel is so 'green', why not put in screened windows so guests may enjoy green fresh air?\nThe view was gorgeous. The elevators were super fast. I recommend this hotel for non-smokers who might want spa services and who like warm temperatures and for whom money is no object. \nWhile we enjoyed our stay, I do not think I will return to this particular hotel."]
